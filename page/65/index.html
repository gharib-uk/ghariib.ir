		<p>Apple&rsquo;s latest bevy of hardware releases feature processor upgrades and some processor naming confusion. The new iPhone 16e is Apple&rsquo;s least expensive iPhone, and it just may be all the phone you need. And why do the new iPads not support Apple&rsquo;s most advertised feature?</p>

<p>In business, the path to value creation requires more than strategic planning and execution—it demands an ability to connect the dots, anticipate needs, and understand the human elements that drive progress. Women often demonstrate these capabilities through their natural inclination to consider multiple perspectives and implications before making decisions. This approach, which emphasizes understanding the complete picture rather than just individual components, can lead to more sustainable and meaningful business outcomes. In honor of International Women’s Day, this blog post invites readers to take a closer look at how women move mountains in the corporate and technology landscapes, encouraging innovation […]</p>

<p>The post Why Java endures: The foundation of modern enterprise development appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Here’s a true story: I learned Java after pretending to be an Android developer when I first started out in software development. While doing that, I quickly learned something important: Java isn’t just a convenient entry point into tech, it’s a strategic career choice.</p>

	<div>
		<p>This Women’s History Month serves as a crucial moment for us to lead and continue to pave the way for a more inclusive future. I am truly honored to support my amazing women colleagues who continue to excel in their careers and am grateful to have so many allies who have extended their hands to help guide and shape me to the person I am today.  </p>
<p>Just last week I was in Tokyo for the Japan Security Forum, where Miki Tsusaka, the President of Microsoft Japan and I had a great conversation during a CyberWomen Asia fireside chat about the importance of women in cybersecurity. Following the chat was a panel discussion with Tsutaki-san, Security leader at Yamaha Motor Corporation and Debbie Furtado, one of our bright Principal group engineering managers. The event highlighted our different perspectives and talents which are invaluable to drive innovation and progress across various industries. I am proud to be a part of Microsoft Security, which is focused on building and nurturing an inclusive cybersecurity workforce and curating careers, tools, and resources that work for everyone. We recognize that this promotes business growth, strengthens global defenses, and enhances AI safety. </p>
