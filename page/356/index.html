<p><em>The Network and Information Security Directive, known as NIS2 and effective beginning October 17, 2024, requires Member States to adopt and publish the national measures necessary to ensure compliance with the directive. Industrial organizations will have 21 months to bring their operations into full compliance.</em></p>

		<p>As the CEO of Tuta Mail, an encrypted email service that TechCrunch has called the &ldquo;encrypted Gmail alternative&rdquo;, I welcome the Department of Justice’s bold move to rein in Google’s dominance. This landmark decision isn’t just about regulating a single company — it’s about standing up for fairness, competition, and a healthier internet ecosystem.</p>

<p>The myth that humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity has persisted for too long. While it’s true that human errors can lead to vulnerabilities, and do indeed cause breaches or incidents, this well repeated narrative overlooks a critical truth: when properly empowered and supported, humans are not just a liability to manage—they are your greatest asset in building a resilient cybersecurity culture.</p>

<p>Imagine your organization&rsquo;s cyber defenses as a well-trained emergency response team. (Work with us here). Just like a strong immune system in a healthy body can fight off infections or the same defensive posture will snap into place in a well trained police unit, <strong>Cyber Resilience in the Human Landscape</strong> means the ability for every person in your organization to be prepared to act swiftly and effectively when cyber threats arise. We think the real magic to this lies not just in the technology but in the behavioral and psychological realm. How quickly and efficiently your people can respond is a question of knowledge, mindset, procedure, behavior, and culture. </p>

		<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The bootstrap process for Oracle Cloud CLI using the “curl | bash” pattern was insecure since there was no way to verify authenticity of the downloaded binaries. The vendor is now publishing checksums that can be used to verify the downloaded binaries.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing research into supply chain attacks, we have been analyzing bash installer scripts using the “curl | basj” pattern. Oracle provides such script used to install the CLI command for interaction with Oracle Cloud. However, there was no way to check whether the files that the script downloads are legitimate, which could potentially open the end-user to supply chain attacks. The installer is run as follows:</p>

<p>When INTERPOL recently announced they would stop using the term “pig butchering” in favor of “romance baiting,” it reminds me that we&rsquo;re overdue for another conversation here on the Cybermaniacs Blog about how we use language and create shared meaning through words, in our unique domain of cybersecurity.</p>

		<p>In 1994, as Professor Peter Shor PhD ’85 tells it, internal seminars at AT&amp;T Bell Labs were lively affairs. The audience of physicists was an active and inquisitive bunch, often pelting speakers with questions throughout their talks. Shor, who worked at Bell Labs at the time, remembers several occasions when a speaker couldn’t get past their third slide, as they attempted to address a rapid line of questioning before their time was up.</p>

<p>When she isn’t sorting algorithms and improving traffic control systems for driverless vehicles, she’s dancing as a member of at least four dance clubs. She’s joined several social justice organizations, worked on cryptography and web authentication technology, and created a polling app that allows users to vote anonymously.</p>
<p>In her final semester, she’s putting the pedal to the metal, with a green light to lessen the carbon footprint of urban transportation by using sensors at traffic light intersections.</p>

		<p>The BBVA Foundation awarded three MIT professors Frontiers of Knowledge Awards for their work in climate change, biology and biomedicine, and quantum computation. Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences Professor Kerry A. Emanuel, Department of Biology Professor David Sabatini, and Department of Mathematics Professor Peter Shor were recognized in the 12th edition of this annual award.</p>
<p><strong>Kerry Emanuel</strong></p>
<p>Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Atmospheric Science, earned the BBVA’s Climate Change award “for his fundamental contributions to the understanding of tropical cyclones and how they are affected by climate change,” according to the committee’s citation. “By understanding the essential physics of atmospheric convection … he has unraveled the behavior of tropical cyclones — hurricanes and typhoons — as our climate changes.” He was also lauded for “extraordinary effectiveness in communicating the science of climate change to the public and policymakers.”</p>
