<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Every time we start a new FastAPI project, we spend hours setting up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project structure</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Security configurations</li>
<li>CI/CD pipelines</li>
<li>Development tools</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Why reinvent the wheel each time?</p>
<h2 id="enter-gitemplate">Enter Gitemplate</h2>

	<div>
		<p>Reverse all the proxies with Nginx for your NAS-powered services.</p>
<p>Running services on your network-attached storage (NAS) device is one thing but it&rsquo;s a different beast to make these securely available to the outside world with SSL certificates, DDNS, and domain names. That&rsquo;s where handy tools such as Nginx, HAProxy, and Traefik come into play. I&rsquo;ve used HAProxy extensively but recently switched to Nginx for a few reasons. These front-end services will catch incoming traffic and route it accordingly, depending on the configuration, what services you&rsquo;re hosting, and conditions set. Here&rsquo;s why you should consider Nginx when looking at reverse proxies.</p>

		<p>Breaking bad habits takes effort, but it’s a necessary step toward improving your Photoshop skills</p>
<p>Photoshop offers endless creative control over your projects, but even experienced users develop bad habits. As a 25-year veteran of Photoshop, I still occasionally catch myself falling back on old habits that I picked up early in my career. Many of these mistakes stem from early learning stages, especially for those who are self-taught users or don’t use Photoshop day-to-day.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the perfect capacitor to decouple the power rails around ICs is a 100 nF ceramic capacitor or equivalent, yet where does this ‘fact’ come from and is it even correct? These are the questions that [Graham] set out to answer once and for all. He starts with an in-depth exploration of the decoupling capacitor (and related) theory. [Graham] then dives into the way that power delivery is affected by the inherent resistance, capacitance, and inductance of traces. This is the problem that decoupling capacitors are supposed to solve.</p>
