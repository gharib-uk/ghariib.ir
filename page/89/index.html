	<div>
		<p>I have been using VMware Core products for the last fifteen years—nine of those years as a VMware Administrator. I went from building basic virtual machines (VMs) to being a VMware Administrator, starting with vSphere/ESXi then handling the other VMware Core products vRealize Operations (Aria Ops), Aria Logs, Site Recovery Manager, and Network and Security (NSX). </p>
<p>Last year, I discovered Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. When I was first introduced to the product, I realized there were many options that would allow me to customize it to my specific environment. OpenShift Virtualization also offered more free rein than VMware. This article explores OpenShift Virtualization as an alternative to VMware.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Wiretapping LLMs: Network Side-Channel Attacks on Interactive LLM Services</strong><br>
<em>Mahdi Soleimani, Grace Jia, In Gim, Seung-seob Lee, Anurag Khandelwal</em></p>
<p>Recent server-side optimizations like speculative decoding significantly enhance the interactivity and resource efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) services. However, we show that these optimizations inadvertently introduce new side-channel vulnerabilities through network packet timing and size variations that tend to be input-dependent. Network adversaries can leverage these side channels to learn sensitive information contained in emph{encrypted} user prompts to and responses from public LLM services.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The cyber threat to critical infrastructure has never been greater. The growing sophistication of cybercriminals, deteriorating geopolitical relations, and the convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) have created unprecedented risks for critical infrastructure organizations. Fortunately, resources are available to help these organizations protect themselves. In late October 2024, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) released Zero Trust Guidance for Critical Infrastructure, a systematic, five-step roadmap to help the world&rsquo;s most important organizations&hellip;</p>
