		<p>Access important notes from any device</p>
<p>I take notes on my smartphone, laptop, and tablet all the time. Whether it&rsquo;s new ideas for articles or a bug that I experience on a device I&rsquo;m testing, I make it a point to note them down since I tend to forget things quite easily. Apart from storing all my notes in one place for quick referencing, I need to be able to access my notes from all of my devices. Since a lot of users have similar requirements, app stores on all platforms are flooded with note-taking apps that cater to this exact use case. So, deciding which tool to use for taking notes and syncing them across your devices can be confusing.</p>

		<p>A new PC build might involve dozens of things to worry about, but these 6 are not some of them</p>
<p>Building a PC is often considered to be an &ldquo;adult LEGO&rdquo; activity, but it can sometimes be a tad intimidating, especially for a first-time builder. Even if you manage to get a great PC parts list from a friend, subreddit, or YouTuber, you still need to assemble everything without making mistakes that could cost hundreds of dollars or more to fix.</p>

		<p>These days, technology moves fast, and the old adage of &rsquo;leave it alone if it&rsquo;s working&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t apply to BIOS updates.</p>
<p>Whether you use a gaming PC with a powerful CPU inside or do most of your gaming on a PC gaming handheld, you&rsquo;ve heard that if your BIOS is working, leave it alone. For the longest time, that was sage advice because BIOS updates ran the risk of bricking the computer, but it&rsquo;s less of a concern with how UEFI BIOS are constructed, and truly bricked devices are rare.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s plenty wrong with the gaming industry that needs to be left in the past, where it belongs.</p>
<p>We love our video games to death, so much so that we&rsquo;re willing to stretch ourselves to buy overpriced GPUs, additional consoles, and way more powerful hardware than we really need, simply to make games look pretty and smooth. What we also love doing (almost as much) is ranting about the things that are wrong with the gaming industry.</p>

<p>High-speed bench equipment has become so much more affordable in the last decade that naturally one wonders what has made that possible. A great source of answers is a teardown by users like [kerry wong] who are kind enough to take apart their MSO2304X 300MHz osilloscope for our viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>The posted teardown video shows the guts of the scope without enclosure, heatsinks and shields that reveal a handful of boards that execute the functions nicely. The motherboard uses the Xilinx KINTEX-7 FPGA that is expected to run core processes such as signal processing as well as managing the sample storage on the paired DDR3 memory.</p>

		<p>DGA is one of the classic techniques for botnets to hide their C2s, attacker only needs to selectively register a very small number of C2 domains, while for the defenders, it is difficult to determine in advance which domain names will be generated and registered.</p>
<p>360 netlab has long focused on the research of botnet attack and defense technology, we maintain a free DGA feed and share the research results with the industry.</p>
