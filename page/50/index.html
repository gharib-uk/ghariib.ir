<p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government initiative that standardizes the assessment, authorization and monitoring of cloud services for security. With the goal of promoting use of secure cloud services across the government, FedRAMP helps reduce costs and duplicative efforts, encourage public-private partnerships for innovation and enhanced security, and accelerate the adoption of cloud computing within federal agencies.</p>

<p>I like to start long blog posts with a tl;dr, so here it is:</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve ingested a corpus of 1.5TB worth of stealer logs known as &ldquo;ALIEN TXTBASE&rdquo; into Have I Been Pwned. They contain 23 billion rows with 493 million unique website and email address pairs, affecting 284M unique email addresses. We&rsquo;ve also added 244M passwords we&rsquo;ve never seen before to Pwned Passwords and updated the counts against another 199M that were already in there. Finally, we now have a way for domain owners to query their entire domain for stealer logs and for website operators to identify customers who have had their email addresses snared when entering them into the site. (Note: stealer logs are still freely and easily searchable by individuals, scroll to the bottom for a walkthrough.)</strong></p>

<p>Scams are big business for cybercriminals, and they’re getting more sophisticated than ever. According to McAfee’s <em>State of the Scamiverse 2025</em> report, the average person encounters 12 scams per day, while Americans see over 14 scam attempts daily, including three deepfake videos.</p>
<p>Fraudsters are leveraging AI-powered tools to create hyper-realistic deepfakes for as little as $5 and 10 minutes, making it harder than ever to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. The financial impact is staggering—87% of scam victims lose money, with one-third losing over $500, and nearly one in ten losing more than $5,000. </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Quantum Key-Recovery Attacks on Permutation-Based Pseudorandom Functions</strong><br>
<em>Hong-Wei Sun</em></p>
<p>Due to their simple security assessments, permutation-based pseudo-random functions (PRFs) have become widely used in cryptography. It has been shown that PRFs using a single $n$-bit permutation achieve $n/2$ bits of security, while those using two permutation calls provide $2n/3$ bits of security in the classical setting. This paper studies the security of permutation-based PRFs within the Q1 model, where attackers are restricted to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We present improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs compared with the previous attacks. Specifically, under the same assumptions/hardware as Grover&rsquo;s exhaustive search attack, i.e. the offline Simon algorithm, we can recover keys in quantum time $tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits. Furthermore, we enhance previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, while maintaining the same time complexity. This implies that permutation-based PRFs become vulnerable when adversaries have access to quantum computing resources. It is pointed out that the above quantum attack can be used to quite a few cryptography, including SoEM, PDMMAC, pEDM, as well as general instantiations like XopEM, EDMEM, EDMDEM, and others.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Business owners and CEOs across the United States received customized ransomware threats this month from the most unusual of places—letters in the mail.</p>
<p>The letters, which were first reported by multiple cybersecurity researchers, claim to come from a ransomware group called BianLian. But since Malwarebytes first started tracking BianLian nearly one year ago, our intelligence analysts have never seen the cybercriminal gang resort to sending physical letters to make their ransom demands, suggesting that the latest snail mail campaign could be the work of copycats.</p>
