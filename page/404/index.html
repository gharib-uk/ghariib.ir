Hackers are exploiting the split-second delay between two mouse clicks to carry out sophisticated clickjacking attacks, tricking victims into authorizing transactions or granting access they never intended. &ldquo;DoubleClickjacking&rdquo; manipulates users into granting OAuth and API permissions</p>

		<p><em>The background and the IOCs for this blog were gathered by an Expert helper on our forums and Malwarebytes researchers. Our thanks go out to them.</em></p>
<p>A new, malicious campaign is making the rounds online and it starts simple: Unwitting targets receive a direct message (DM) on a Discord server asking about their interest in beta testing a new videogame (targets can also receive a text message or an email). Often, the message comes from the “developer” themselves, as asking whether you can try a game that they personally made is a common method to lure victims.</p>

		<p>More and more, threat actors are leveraging the browser to deliver malware in ways that can evade detection from antivirus programs. Social engineering is a core part of these schemes and the tricks we see are sometimes very clever.</p>
<p>Case in point, there has been an increase in attacks that involve copying a malicious command into the clipboard, only to be later pasted and executed by the victims themselves. Who would have though that copy/paste could be so dangerous?</p>

		<p>Feature flags offer an excellent way to quickly turn off and on product changes by enabling you to remove and add the code in the software quickly. Marketers or product managers can choose a time and moment to make a feature or function live to win that aha moment.</p>
<p>The feature flags are helpful to various departments, including marketing, product, testing, CROs, and development. The number of feature flags can rise quickly as the team realizes their helpfulness and begins to utilize them. To avoid the mismanagement it may create, you need feature flag platforms. A comprehensive space where you can place all your feature flags and manage, modify, and delete them.</p>

		<p>A popular saying is: “To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.”</p>
<p>Even though the saying is older than you might think, it did not come about earlier than the concept of artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p>And as long as we have been waiting for AI technology to become commonplace, if AI has taught us one thing this year, then it’s that when humans and AI cooperate, amazing things can happen. But amazing is not always positive.</p>

		<p>As I think back on my time since joining as CEO earlier this year, I want to reflect on DigitalOcean’s accomplishments in 2024. From accelerated product development to re-invigorated community efforts, this was a year of transformation for DigitalOcean. As the simplest scalable cloud, DigitalOcean is committed to serving our customers by designing simple yet robust products, helping them succeed through hands-on support, and inspiring them with developer events and educational content. Let’s dive in.</p>

		<p>Most teams start with basic security practices, such as branch protection and simple access controls. But, there&rsquo;s often a moment when teams realize they need more. It could be when they land their first enterprise client, when they start handling sensitive data, or when they experience their first security incident.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure whether you’re ready to upgrade your security, here are a few signs you’ve outgrown your security needs:</p>

		<p>As development teams grow, what once worked for a small team often becomes a bottleneck. Code standards become inconsistent, operational silos develop, and technical debt accumulates faster. What was a well-oiled machine is now dysfunctional as more team members, projects, and tools are added on.</p>
<p>Many teams experience these challenges as they grow, but how you handle and address these growing pains can save you time, energy, and money in the long run. In this article, we’ll explore the common pitfalls growing teams face and how successful organizations address them.</p>
