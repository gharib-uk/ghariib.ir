<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that we reported on someone who got Tetris working in a PDF document. Of course, the next logical step was to get Doom running on it, which they managed to do. However, it turns out that the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. The feat inspired people to attempt to cram the classic FPS into as many productivity-based apps as possible, and now Microsoft Word has fallen victim to the Doom enthusiasts&rsquo; endless crusade to get it running on everything possible.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-13401<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 17, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 46 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Payment Button for PayPal plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin&rsquo;s &lsquo;wp_paypal_checkout&rsquo; shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.3.35 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 6.4 | MEDIUM<br>

		<p>According to a DOJ press release, the FBI was able to delete the Chinese-used PlugX malware from “approximately 4,258 U.S.-based computers and networks.”</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To retrieve information from and send commands to the hacked machines, the malware connects to a command-and-control server that is operated by the hacking group. According to the FBI, at least 45,000 IP addresses in the US had back-and-forths with the command-and-control server since September 2023.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t work on that day, I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to be ill.</p>
<p>RPGs on portable consoles are always a treat; you can grind levels or farm for materials while you&rsquo;re traveling, waiting for something, or just a quick session during bedtime. So, when I heard that my favorite modern RPG had gotten Steam Deck verification before its PC debut, you know I had to report on it. If you, too, share my desire to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on the Steam Deck during a cold winter&rsquo;s day, then I have some news for you.</p>
