		<p>There’s no doubt about it: The password era is ending. Bad actors know it, which is why they’re desperately accelerating password-related attacks while they still can.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, we block 7,000 attacks on passwords per second—almost double from a year ago. At the same time, we’ve seen adversary-in-the-middle phishing attacks increase by 146% year over year.1 Fortunately, we’ve never had a better solution to these pervasive attacks: passkeys.</p>
<p>Passkeys not only offer an improved user experience by letting you sign in faster with your face, fingerprint, or PIN, but they also aren’t susceptible to the same kinds of attacks as passwords. Plus, passkeys eliminate forgotten passwords and one-time codes and reduce support calls.</p>

	<div>
		<p>CrackMapExec (a.k.a CME) is a post-exploitation tool that helps automate assessing the security of large Active Directory networks. Built with stealth in mind, CME follows the concept of “Living off the Land”: abusing built-in Active Directory features/protocols to achieve its functionality and allowing it to evade most endpoint protection/IDS/IPS solutions. CME makes heavy use of […]</p>
