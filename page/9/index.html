		<p>Development and security teams are often overwhelmed by the number of vulnerabilities they need to remediate. Many organizations remediate less than 16% of their known vulnerabilities monthly. Vulnerability management teams face a constant challenge: which security flaws deserve immediate attention? Three key frameworks help answer this question: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV), and Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). The GitLab 17.9 release adds support for these frameworks. In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use these frameworks within GitLab to efficiently prioritize risk across your dependency and container image vulnerabilities using this data.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I&rsquo;ve finally caught my breath after dealing with those 23 billion rows of stealer logs last week. That was a bit intense, as is usually the way after any large incident goes into HIBP. But the confusing nature of stealer logs coupled with an overtly long blog post explaining them and the conflation of which services needed a subscription versus which were easily accessible by anyone made for a very intense last 6 days. And there were the issues around source data integrity on top of everything else, but I&rsquo;ll come back to that.</p>

		<p>The Git project recently released Git 2.49.0. Let&rsquo;s look at a few notable highlights from this release, which includes contributions from GitLab&rsquo;s Git team and the wider Git community.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>git-backfill(1) and the new path-walk API</li>
<li>Introduction of zlib-ng</li>
<li>Continued iteration on Meson</li>
<li>Deprecation of .git/branches/ and .git/remotes/</li>
<li>Rust bindings for libgit</li>
<li>New name-hashing algorithm</li>
<li>Promisor remote capability</li>
<li>Thin clone using <code>--revision</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git-backfill1-and-the-new-path-walk-api">git-backfill(1) and the new path-walk API</h2>
<p>When you <code>git-clone(1)</code> a Git repository, you can pass it the <code>--filter</code> option. Using this option allows you to create a <em>partial clone</em>. In a partial clone the server only sends a subset of reachable objects according to the given object filter. For example, creating a clone with <code>--filter=blob:none</code> will not fetch any blobs (file contents) from the server and create a <em>blobless clone</em>.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/2024-why-ipv6/">&lt;div&gt;Why content providers need IPv6&lt;/div&gt;</a></h1>
	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>IPv4 is an expensive resource. However, many content providers are still IPv4-only. The most common reason is that IPv4 is here to stay and IPv6 is an additional complexity.1 This mindset may seem selfish, but there are compelling reasons for a content provider to enable IPv6, even when they have enough IPv4 addresses available for their needs.</p>
<p>Disclaimer</p>
<p>It’s been a while since this article has been in my drafts. I started it when I was working at Shadow, a content provider, while I now work for Free, an internet service provider.</p>

</p>
<p>It happened again last week. I was at an architecture review meeting when a fellow architect eagerly started another debate about *microservices*. Within minutes, eyes glazed over and we were knee-deep in an absurd discussion about something that should have been a means to an end, but had morphed into the end itself. At that moment, I realized: I’m done. I’ve finally sworn off talking to architects about microservices. Why? Because these conversations usually go nowhere productive.</p>

		<p>This year, Spring Break vacationers are packing more than their flip-flops, bucket hats, and sunglasses—they’re also packing a few cybersecurity anxieties for the trip.</p>
<p>According to new research from Malwarebytes, 52% of people said they “worry about being scammed while traveling,” while another 40% admitted that they “worry about my kids or family sharing trip details online.” While most people said they will act on these concerns—63% will make sure their security software is up to date, 53% will back up their data—roughly 10% of people said they will take no precautions whatsoever into protecting their security or privacy while on vacation.</p>

		<p>Linux is over 30 years old, powering businesses all over the world, and yet there are still misconceptions about what it is and how it works. That’s understandable. After all, one reason Linux is special is because it is unique. It doesn’t always work the way other operating systems do, and that’s frankly a good thing. Here are 10 myths about Linux that are getting rather old, and that modern Linux has, quite simply, surpassed.Unstoppable Linux: 3 things Red Hat Enterprise Linux has kept for 30 years1.

		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is excited to announce that a new Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) report (2024 H2) is now available through AWS Artifact. An independent Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) certified IRAP assessor completed the IRAP assessment of AWS in February 2025.</p>
<p>The new IRAP report includes an additional six AWS services that are now assessed at the PROTECTED level under IRAP. This brings the total number of services assessed at the PROTECTED level to 164.</p>
