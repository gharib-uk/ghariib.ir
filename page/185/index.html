<p>Video game hacks, cracked software, and free crypto tools remain popular bait for malware authors. Recently, McAfee Labs uncovered several GitHub repositories offering these tempting “rewards,” but a closer look reveals something more sinister. As the saying goes, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>GitHub is often exploited for malware distribution due to its accessibility, trustworthiness, and developer-friendly features. Attackers can easily create free accounts and host repositories that appear legitimate, leveraging GitHub’s reputation to deceive users.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered what makes a computer tick, the Minimal 64×4 by [Slu4] is bound to grab your attention. It’s not a modern powerhouse, but a thoughtfully crafted throwback to the essence of computing. With just 61 logic ICs, VGA output, PS/2 input, and SSD storage, this DIY wonder packs four times the processing power of a Commodore 64.</p>
<p>What sets [Slu4]’s efforts apart is his refusal to follow the beaten track of CPU development. He imposes strict complexity limits on his designs, sticking to an ultra-minimalist Von Neumann architecture. His journey began with the ‘Minimal Ur-CPU’, a logic-chip-based computer that could crunch numbers but little else. Next came the ‘Minimal 64’, featuring VGA graphics and Space Invaders-level performance. The latest ‘Minimal 64×4’ takes it further, adding incredible speed while keeping the design so simple it’s almost ridiculous. It’s computing stripped to its rawest form—no fancy sound, no dazzling graphics, just raw resourcefulness.</p>

<p>Adversaries frequently leverage legitimate tools in their malicious campaigns. The popular AnyDesk remote utility has also been largely exploited by hackers for offensive purposes. Cyber defenders have unveiled the recent misuse of AnyDesk software to connect to targeted computers, masquerading the malicious efforts as CERT-UA activity.</p>
<h2 id="detect-cyber-attacks-exploiting-anydesk-based-on-cert-ua-research">Detect Cyber-Attacks Exploiting AnyDesk Based on CERT-UA Research</h2>
<p>Adversaries often exploit remote management tools for malicious purposes. For instance, the Remote Utilities software has been extensively used in offensive campaigns targeting Ukraine. The latest CERT-UA alert sheds light on the misuse of another legitimate remote access tool, AnyDesk, which lures victims into leveraging the compromised tool under the false claim of conducting a security audit. SOC Prime Platform for collective cyber defense curates a relevant set of detection algorithms that help security engineers define which hosts are used by AnyDesk to minimize the risks of intrusions. Since adversaries know AnyDesk IDs and attempt to connect to hosts impersonating CERT-UA, SOC Prime offers the relevant SOC content to detect these instances with the IDs, which are potentially the targets.</p>

		<p>Managing the keyboard when it appears on the screen is crucial in mobile app development to ensure a seamless user experience. React Native provides several ways to handle this using components like <code>KeyboardAvoidingView</code>, <code>KeyboardAwareScrollView</code>, and platform-specific configurations. Below are some common approaches to manage the keyboard behavior effectively.</p>

		<p>The energy sector is the cornerstone of modern infrastructure, powering essential services and supporting the daily operations of economies worldwide. However, it also faces unique cybersecurity challenges, particularly in complying with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation&rsquo;s Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) standards. Cyber threats keep growing in sophistication and frequency and the sector&rsquo;s critical assets—such as power grids, pipelines, and renewable energy networks—face unprecedented risk. The implications of a cyberattack on these systems extend far beyond&hellip;</p>

	<b><time>22.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Nearly half (45%) of developers say they don’t have enough time for learning and development, according to a developer experience research study by Harness and Wakefield Research. Additionally, developer onboarding is a slow and painful process, with 71% of executive buyers saying that onboarding new developers takes at least two months. </p>
<p>To accelerate innovation and bring products to market faster, organizations must empower developers with robust support and intuitive guardrails, enabling them to succeed within a structured yet flexible environment. That’s where Docker fits in: We help developers onboard quickly and help organizations set up the right guardrails to give developers the flexibility to innovate within the boundaries of company policies. </p>
