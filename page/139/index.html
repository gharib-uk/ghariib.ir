		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Symmetric Perceptrons, Number Partitioning and Lattices</strong><br>
<em>Neekon Vafa, Vinod Vaikuntanathan</em></p>
<p>The symmetric binary perceptron ($mathrm{SBP}_{kappa}$) problem with parameter $kappa : mathbb{R}_{geq1} to [0,1]$ is an average-case search problem defined as follows: given a random Gaussian matrix $mathbf{A} sim mathcal{N}(0,1)^{n times m}$ as input where $m geq n$, output a vector $mathbf{x} in {-1,1}^m$ such that $$|| mathbf{A} mathbf{x} ||_{infty} leq kappa(m/n) cdot sqrt{m}~.$$ The number partitioning problem ($mathrm{NPP}_{kappa}$) corresponds to the special case of setting $n=1$. There is considerable evidence that both problems exhibit large computational-statistical gaps. In this work, we show (nearly) tight average-case hardness for these problems, assuming the worst-case hardness of standard approximate shortest vector problems on lattices.</p>

		<p>In the early part of 2024, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) released the latest version of the well-respected Critical Security Controls (CSC). The new version, 8.1, adds contours to the prior versions, making it more comprehensive and timely in today’s challenging cybersecurity environment. The CIS CSC has been a valued source of guidance for many organizations since its initial release in 2008. However, its detail and depth make it somewhat intimidating for some organizations. The latest version contains 153 safeguards. In a recent webinar, I reviewed the new version and highlighted&hellip;</p>

	<div>
		<p>Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors, analyzes, and processes Amazon Web Services (AWS) data sources and logs in your AWS environment. GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, file hashes, and machine learning (ML) models to identify suspicious and potentially malicious activity in your AWS environment. When GuardDuty identifies a potential security issue, it creates a GuardDuty finding that gives you information about what the potential security issue is, the resources involved, and contextualized information that’s key to remediating the issue. GuardDuty helps you monitor for the latest threats by continually expanding threat detection to emerging and common threats.</p>

<p>We’ve said it before: building one-offs is different from building at scale. Even on a small scale. There was a time when it was rare for a hobbyist to produce more than one of anything, but these days, access to cheap PC boards makes small production runs much more common. [VoltLog], for example, is selling some modules and found he was spening a lot of time testing the boards. The answer? A testing jig for his PC board.</p>

		<p>These PC building tasks are laborious, but unavoidable.</p>
<p>PC building can be a relatively drama-free affair. It’s never been easier to buy the parts and put them together yourself, but that doesn’t mean it’s always smooth sailing. The more tedious PC building tasks do get easier to deal with as you gain more experience with components, but it doesn’t make them any more enjoyable. These 5 tasks are some of the most difficult, but there are some ways to make them less painful.</p>
