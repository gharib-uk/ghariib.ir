<p>At least some in the audience will at some time in the distant past have loaded or saved a program on cassette, with an 8-bit home computer. The machine would encode binary as a series of tones which could be recorded to the tape and then later retrieved. If you consider the last sentence you’ll quickly realize that it’s not too far away from what a modem does, so can a modem record to cassette and decode it back afterwards? [Jesse T] set out to give it a try, and as it turns out, yes you can.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A practical distinguisher on the full Skyscraper permutation</strong><br>
<em>Antoine Bak</em></p>
<p>Skyscraper is a cryptographic permutation published in TCHES 2025, optimized for use in proof systems such as PlonK. This primitive is based on a 10-round Feistel network combining $x^2$ monomials and lookup-based functions to achieve competitive plain performances and efficiency in proof systems supporting lookups. In terms of security, the $x^2$ monomials are supposed to provide security against statistical attacks, while lookups are supposed to provide security against algebraic attacks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Additive Randomized Encodings from Public Key Encryption</strong><br>
<em>Nir Bitansky, Saroja Erabelli, Rachit Garg</em></p>
<p>Introduced by Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin (CRYPTO 2023), Additive randomized encodings (ARE) reduce the computation of a $k$-party function $f(x_1,dots,x_k)$ to locally computing encodings $hat x_i$ of each input $x_i$ and then adding them together over some Abelian group into an output encoding $hat y = sum hat x_i$, which reveals nothing but the result. The appeal of ARE comes from the simplicity of the non-local computation, involving only addition. This gives rise for instance to non-interactive secure function evaluation in the shuffle model where messages from different parties are anonymously shuffled before reaching their destination. Halevi, Ishai, Kushilevitz, and Rabin constructed ARE based on Diffie-Hellman type assumptions in bilinear groups.</p>

<p>The digital world is transforming at lightning speed, and AI is no longer just an option in cybersecurity; it’s a game-changer. As businesses accelerate their digital journeys, they’re harnessing AI to supercharge decision-making, embracing the cloud for unmatched scalability, and adapting to industry shifts to outpace competitors.</p>
<p>But transformation isn’t just about tech; it’s about reshaping how organizations operate and deliver value. With these advancements, however, come growing cyber risks. The more businesses expand their digital footprints, the more they open doors to potential vulnerabilities.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Better Codes for the HQC Cryptosystem</strong><br>
<em>Cyrius Nugier, Jean-Christophe Deneuville</em></p>
<p>In the HQC cryptosystem, the length $n$ of the code determines several concrete parameters such as the bandwidth usage, the memory consumption, or the decoding efficiency. In this paper, we show that currently known methods to explicitly generate asymptotically good (especially with high relative distances), binary codes with efficient associated procedures cannot be used to improve $n$. We also show that concatenated codes are currently better suited, and by exhausting small codes, find a closer to optimal concatenated code for HQC, which improves upon currently used codes.</p>
