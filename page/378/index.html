		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Exploring Large Integer Multiplication for Cryptography Targeting In-Memory Computing</strong><br>
<em>Florian Krieger, Florian Hirner, Sujoy Sinha Roy</em></p>
<p>Emerging cryptographic systems such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are computation- and data-intensive. FHE and ZKP implementations in software and hardware largely rely on the von Neumann architecture, where a significant amount of energy is lost on data movements. A promising computing paradigm is computing in memory (CIM), which enables computations to occur directly within memory, thereby reducing data movements and energy consumption. However, efficiently performing large integer multiplications - critical in FHE and ZKP - is an open question, as existing CIM methods are limited to small operand sizes. In this work, we address this question by exploring advanced algorithmic approaches for large integer multiplication, identifying the Karatsuba algorithm as the most effective for CIM applications. Thereafter, we design the first Karatsuba multiplier for resistive CIM crossbars. Our multiplier uses a three-stage pipeline to enhance throughput and, additionally, balances memory endurance with efficient array sizes. Compared to existing CIM multiplication methods, when scaled up to the bit widths required in ZKP and FHE, our design achieves up to 916x in throughput and 281x in area-time product improvements.</p>

<p>VirusTotal stores a vast collection of files, URLs, domains, and IPs submitted by users worldwide. It features a variety of functionalities and integrates third-party detection engines and tools to analyze the maliciousness of submitted artifacts and gather relevant related information, such as file properties, domain registrars, and execution behaviors. </p>
<p>The VirusTotal dataset, the backbone of the platform, structures artifact-related information into objects and represents relevant relationships between them, providing contextual links between various artifacts. This makes VirusTotal a valuable resource for threat research, enabling users to perform activities such as clustering artifacts related to specific threat actors or campaigns, tracking malicious activities, and analyzing trends in the threat landscape. </p>

		<p>The <strong>MITRE</strong> framework helps all defenders speak the same language regarding attackers&rsquo; modus operandi. VirusTotal provides multiple data points where MITRE&rsquo;s Tactics and Techniques are dynamically extracted from samples when detonated in our sandboxes. In particular, samples&rsquo; MITRE mapping can be found under the <strong>BEHAVIOR</strong> tab of a file&rsquo;s report. This data is searchable in <strong>VirusTotal Intelligence</strong> (VTI) with the help of a set of specific file search modifiers.</p>
<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll illustrate how security analysts can leverage MITRE for malware detection and <strong>behavior</strong>-based hunting for ransomware and keylogger samples.</p>
