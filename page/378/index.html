		<p>Create your own custom router with an old PC.</p>
<p>OPNsense will run on just about anything, including a low-power Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC). I have an old Minisforum NucBox 2 collecting dust and decided to throw OPNsense on the system to act as a testbench of sorts for loading up plugins, configuring various parts of the firewall OS, and testing deployments before applying changes to my primary OPNsense device, which was a purchase specifically for running as a router.</p>

<p>Ever hear one of those stories where as it unravels, you lean in ever closer and mutter “No way! <em>No way! NO WAY!</em>” This one, as far as infosec stories go, had me leaning and muttering like never before. Here goes:</p>
<p>Last week, someone reached out to me with what they claimed was a Spoutible data breach obtained by exploiting an enumerable API. Just your classic case of putting someone else&rsquo;s username in the URL and getting back data about them, which at first glance I assumed was another scraping situation like we recently saw with Trello. They sent me a file with 207k scraped records and a URL that looked like this:</p>

		<p>How to use BitLocker to encrypt your external drives</p>
<p>Windows 11, Windows 10, and even older versions come pre-installed with a security and encryption feature called BitLocker. It enables users to encrypt everything on the drive where Windows is installed, protecting that data from theft or unauthorized access. If you haven’t heard of it, that’s because the feature isn’t available on every Windows PC. It is only available on the Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.</p>

		<p>Please note that this blogpost is part of our #VTMondays series, check out our collection of past publications here.</p>
<p>Many cyberattacks begin by victims visiting compromised websites that host malware or phishing scams, threat actors use domains for different malicious purposes as part of their infrastructure, and malware communicates with external sites for command and control and exfiltration. Detecting suspicious domains and preemptively feeding corporate security systems can disrupt attacks before they happen, with VT Intelligence being the perfect platform to early detect them and monitor malicious campaigns’ evolution.</p>

		<p>Craft is now available for Windows and is an excellent productivity tool</p>
<p>For years, Mac users have sung the praises of Craft, a sleek and powerful note-taking app that promises to redefine how we jot down notes, create documents, and publish them on the web. After being exclusive to the Apple platform for years, Craft has finally arrived for Windows. As a long-time Windows user, I couldn’t resist taking it for a spin, especially after the recent version 3.0 update brought some much-awaited features to the table.</p>
