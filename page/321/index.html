<p>When I started my career as an engineer in the early noughties, I was very keen on developer experience (devex).</p>
<p>So when I joined a company whose chosen language was TCL (no, really), I decided to ask the engineering mailing list what IDEs they used. Surely the senior engineers, with all their wisdom and experience, would tell which of the many IDEs available at the time made them the most productive? This was decades before ‘developer experience’ had a name, but nonetheless it was exactly what I was talking about, and what people fretted about.</p>
