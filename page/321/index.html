		<p>In the constantly changing world of cybersecurity, generative AI is becoming an increasingly valuable tool. This blog post shows various examples that elude traditional detection engines yet are adeptly unveiled by Code Insight. We explore diverse scenarios, ranging from firmware patches in DJI drones that disable red flight lights, to the covert theft of WhatsApp session cookies, phishing targeting Tesla customers, automated login attempts on the Medtronic CareLink Network, Bitcoin wallet attacks, Tik-Tok viewbots, unauthorized Netflix account access, cheaters for Roblox, and automation of Tinder’s match-making, along with a range of other scenarios.</p>

	<b><time>05.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Bitdefender researchers investigated a series of incidents at high-level organizations in countries of the South China Sea region, all performed by the same  threat actor we track as Unfading Sea Haze. Based on the victimology and the cyber-attack’s aim, we believe the threat actor is aligned with China’s interests. As tensions in the region rise, they are reflected in the intensification of activity on behalf of the Unfading Sea Haze actor, which uses new and improved tools and TTPs.</p>

		<p>In a world ran by advertising, businesses and organizations are not the only ones using this powerful tool. Cybercriminals have a knack for exploiting the engine that powers online platforms by corrupting the vast reach of advertising to distribute malware en masse.</p>
<p>While legitimate businesses rely on ads to reach new audiences, hackers exploit these platforms to trick users into downloading harmful software. Malicious ads often seem to promote legitimate software, streaming services, or produc</p>

	<b><time>05.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>VirusTotal has incorporated a powerful new tool to fight against malware: <strong>JA4 client fingerprinting</strong>. This feature allows security researchers to track and identify malicious files based on the unique characteristics of their TLS client communications.</p>
<h3 id="ja4-a-more-robust-successor-to-ja3">JA4: A More Robust Successor to JA3</h3>
<p>JA4, developed by FoxIO, represents a significant advancement over the older JA3 fingerprinting method. JA3&rsquo;s effectiveness had been hampered by the increasing use of TLS extension randomization in https clients, which made fingerprints less consistent. JA4 was specifically designed to be resilient to this randomization, resulting in more stable and reliable fingerprints.</p>
