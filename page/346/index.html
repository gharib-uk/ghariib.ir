		<p>No one likes ads, but the free Gmail - a very popular email provider - continues to ignore its users demands at this crucial point. While seemingly the perfect email solution with lots of features and plenty of storage, Gmail shows more advertisements to its users than most email services. This advertising must be stopped!</p>

<p>Good news this week from the Sun’s far side as the Parker Solar Probe checked in after its speedrun through our star’s corona. Parker became the fastest human-made object ever — aside from the manhole cover, of course — as it fell into the Sun’s gravity well on Christmas Eve to pass within 6.1 million kilometers of the surface, in an attempt to study the extremely dynamic environment of the solar atmosphere. Similar to how manned spacecraft returning to Earth are blacked out from radio communications, the plasma soup Parker flew through meant everything it would do during the pass had to be autonomous, and we wouldn’t know how it went until the probe cleared the high-energy zone. The probe pinged Earth with a quick “I’m OK” message on December 26, and checked in with the Deep Space Network as scheduled on January 1, dumping telemetry data that indicated the spacecraft not only survived its brush with the corona but that every instrument performed as expected during the pass. The scientific data from the instruments won’t be downloaded until the probe is in a little better position, and then Parker will get to do the whole thing again twice more in 2025.</p>

		<p>While external cyberattacks often make the headlines, internal security risks (aka insider risks) present a significant danger that is sometimes underestimated. These risks can arise from disgruntled employees, negligent insiders, or malicious actors with privileged access. The repercussions of such breaches can be severe, resulting in data loss, financial harm, legal fines, and harm to reputation.</p>
<p>Effectively managing internal security threats requires a careful and balanced approach. Implementing overly strict measures can hinder creativity and dampen current employee morale, yet having weak security protocols can leave organizations open to exploitation. This article delves into the various facets of internal threats, exploring the potential outcomes and examining the essential elements of a strong internal security plan.</p>

<p>There are already many backend libraries and frameworks for Node.js on the market. I&rsquo;ve used Nest.js for some small projects before. It has comprehensive functions and enables rapid project implementation. However, for my small projects, many of its features are really overkill, and it has a high level of encapsulation, leaving little freedom when writing code.</p>
<p>By chance, I came across Hono online. After reading its documentation:</p>

		<p>Security leaders continue to be under intense pressure. Increasingly, they are turning toward third parties for support and expertise as their cybersecurity woes become more dire and it becomes harder to recruit and retain talent.  This is reflected in the projected growth for cybersecurity services through 20281 (managed security services, managed detection and response, security consulting, and security professional services).</p>
<p>According to Gartner1, end-user spending for all security services will grow from $77.4 billion in 2024 to $116.9 billion in 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 percent. Managed detection and response (MDR) is forecasted to be the highest growth area of security services, with a projected 17.1 percent CAGR through 2028. This is in part due to the continued, acute need for support with threat monitoring, detection, and response. However, it’s also due to a growing need for help with risk identification, management and governance, exposure and vulnerability management, and incident readiness due to increasingly stringent requirements by regulators for reporting in these areas.</p>
