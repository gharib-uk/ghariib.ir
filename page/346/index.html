		<p>How to guard against new threats in 2025: seven resolutions to boost cybersecurity</p>
<p>The outgoing 2024 brought a number of record-breaking data breaches — from the Taylor Swift concert ticket case, to the incident with 100 million Americans’ medical records. AI technology and cybercrime made leaps and bounds all year long. So how can you stay on top of all this to ensure personal information security? Here’s how: make these seven New Year resolutions — and stick to them throughout 2025.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As we look ahead to 2025, businesses across Asia Pacific (APAC) are expected to accelerate their adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity, using it as a critical tool to combat evolving AI-powered threats.</p>
<p>With 43% of security professionals predicting that these sophisticated threats will increasingly evade traditional detection methods, organizations are poised to leverage AI-driven strategies to proactively mitigate risks. At the same time, there is a growing push to secure AI systems themselves, evidenced by initiatives like Singapore’s recent AI security guidelines – trends that are likely to shape cybersecurity practices across the region in the coming year.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>It may sound weird when I say that I would like to remember 2024 as the year of the biggest breaches. That’s mainly because that would mean we’ll never see another year like it.</p>
<p>To support this nomination, I will remind you of several high-profile breaches, some of a size almost beyond imagination, some that really left us worried because of the type of data that was stolen, and a few duds.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Senators introduced a bill on Tuesday that would prohibit data brokers from selling or transferring location and health data.</p>
<p>Data brokers have drawn attention this year by leaking several large databases, with the worst being the National Public Data leak. The data breach made international headlines because it affected hundreds of millions of people, and it included Social Security Numbers.</p>
<p>All this when data brokers had already been faced with reforms in the shape of the American Privacy Rights Act (APRA). Hwoever, APRA is not expected to pass before Congress wraps up for the year, and some lawmakers feel the need for extra data regulations.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Remediation has long been a sore spot in data security posture management (DSPM). Many of the currently available solutions are great at surfacing alerts but offer no real way for Security teams to take action without a separate effort to integrate with external remediation tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’re happy to announce a new and ready-to-use integration between Prisma Cloud DSPM and Cortex XSOAR. This latest development allows organizations to automatically remediate data security risks (or initiate relevant remediation workflows) and to easily incorporate data security risks, policies and classifications into new and existing remediation playbooks. For Palo Alto Networks, this represents another step toward our vision of further platformization in cloud security.</p>
