Some of us might remember this 15-year-old <em>Abstruse Goose</em> comic about our choices in life. Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics – or as it’s often somewhat erroneously labeled – physics. Many years ago, I did a course on rigid body dynamics that was definitely a part of the theoretical mechanics curriculum, not physics! Then, you’ll probably also need a bit of materials science, optics, and a smattering of other subjects. The good news is you’ll have loads of fun along the way. And while you’re still learning, game development engines and libraries can help you keep on top of some of the accidental complexity and give you enough functionality to implement the things you want, albeit at a fairly basic level.</p>

		<p>We’re happy to announce that we’ve made significant progress in updating our web authentication stack on Azure DevOps services and partner web properties to utilize Microsoft Entra tokens to handle web sessions.</p>
<p>By replacing our previous cookies with Entra tokens, we’ve deepened the integration we have with Microsoft Entra ID on our web experience. This change allows us to continuously evaluate identity compliance with Entra policies on an hourly basis (the duration of an Entra token).</p>

		<p>Introducing agent mode for GitHub Copilot in VS Code, announcing the general availability of Copilot Edits, and providing a first look at our SWE agent.</p>
<p>The post GitHub Copilot: The agent awakens appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>When we introduced GitHub Copilot back in 2021, we had a clear goal: to make developers’ lives easier with an AI pair programmer that helps them write better code. The name reflects our belief that artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t replacing the developer. Instead, it’s always on their side. And like any good first officer, Copilot can also fly by itself: for example, when providing pull request feedback, autofixing security vulnerabilities, or brainstorming on how to implement an issue.</p>

<p><em>Their method scrambles laser beams into chaotic patterns, making decryption impossible without a trained neural network. This innovation could revolutionize cryptography.</em></p>
<p><strong>Holograms for Next-Level Encryption</strong></p>
<p>As the demand for digital security grows, researchers have developed a new optical system that uses holograms to encode information, creating a level of encryption that traditional methods cannot penetrate. This advance could pave the way for more secure communication channels, helping to protect sensitive data.</p>
