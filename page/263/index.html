<p>TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding optional static types. This means that while you can write JavaScript in TypeScript, you also have the ability to define the types of variables, function parameters, and objects, leading to improved code quality and developer experience. Types in TypeScript allow you to specify what kind of data can be used, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.</p>

<p>What if your old, neglected toys could come to life — with a bit of sass? That’s exactly what [Binh] achieved when he transformed his sister’s worn-out teddy bear into ‘Ted’, an interactive talking plush with a personality of its own. This project, which combines the GLaDOS Personality Core project from the <em>Portal</em> series with clever microcontroller tinkering, brings a whole new personality to a childhood favorite.</p>

Real-time AI subtitling is in the works for VLC, the phenomenally popular open-source media player. VideoLAN, the non-profit in charge of VLC development, demoed automatic subtitle generation in VLC during CES 2025 —where not using AI made you stand out this year— and shared a clip of the feature in action at their CES booth on X last week. No cloud service or internet connection is needed for VLC to auto-generate subtitles with AI. The feature works offline to provide real-time translation support for more 100+ languages; is able to translate/display two languages at once; and can ‘save’ translations to […]</p>

<p>This week I&rsquo;m giving a little teaser as to what&rsquo;s coming with stealer logs in HIBP and in about 24 hours from the time of writing, you&rsquo;ll be able to see the whole thing in action. This has been a huge amount of work trawling through vast volumes of data and trying to make it usable by the masses, but I think what we&rsquo;re launchung tomorrow will be awesome. Along with a new feature around these stealer logs, we&rsquo;ve also added a huge number of new passwords to Pwned Passwords not previously seen before. Now, for the first time ever, &ldquo;fuckkangaroos&rdquo; will be flagged by any websites using the service 😮 More awesome examples coming in tomorrow&rsquo;s blog post, stay tuned!</p>

		<p>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and RHEL for edge provide very similar benefits and operational workflows, and also address similar use cases. Image mode is becoming the preferred deployment method in RHEL 10, so in this article we&rsquo;ll go over what this means for users of RHEL for edge.If you’re following news about the upcoming RHEL 10 release (currently in beta) or about Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI (RHEL AI), you’ve heard about image mode for RHEL. And, if you’re a user of RHEL for edge, which is also a part of Red Hat Device Edge, you&rsquo;ll have noticed that both start from</p>
