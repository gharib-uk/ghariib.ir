		<p>Developers play a critical role in ensuring banks remain competitive and compliant. One framework gaining significant attention is DORA. If you’re thinking of the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics, this is something different. The Digital Operational Resilience Act is a new regulatory framework focused on safeguarding financial institutions against digital disruptions. For developers, understanding DORA regulations is not just a regulatory necessity; it’s an opportunity to drive innovation and enhance the overall stability of their organizations.</p>

	<div>
		<p>You&rsquo;ll have no trouble playing all your favorite games.</p>
<p>There are some excellent Linux distros available, but not all of them are designed with gaming in mind. Pop!_OS may have a strange name, but this distro from System76 promises some of the best gaming performance, thanks to tweaks, a focus on PC games, and support for game launchers out of the box. This also happens to be one of the better choices if you&rsquo;re a beginner to the Linux ecosystem. I&rsquo;ll show you some reasons why you should consider it for your next gaming rig OS.</p>

		<p>AMD has some cool tech on the way for its next-gen GPUs.</p>
<p>AMD has found itself in quite the situation. Nvidia continues to dominate the top-end of the GPU market with the $1,999 announcement of the RTX 5090, but the company is also experiencing competition in the lower end from Intel with the new B-series. AMD&rsquo;s RX 7000 series GPUs were solid performers and the RX 7900 XTX was one of my favorites from this most recent GPU generation. However, FSR didn&rsquo;t compete against DLSS and even Intel is using AI for its super sampling tech, so AMD is bringing FSR 4 to the table with next-gen RDNA 4 GPUs, and here&rsquo;s why you should be excited.</p>

		<p>Microsoft’s AI red team is excited to share our whitepaper, “Lessons from Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products.”</p>
<p>The AI red team was formed in 2018 to address the growing landscape of AI safety and security risks. Since then, we have expanded the scope and scale of our work significantly. We are one of the first red teams in the industry to cover both security and responsible AI, and red teaming has become a key part of Microsoft’s approach to generative AI product development. Red teaming is the first step in identifying potential harms and is followed by important initiatives at the company to measure, manage, and govern AI risk for our customers. Last year, we also announced PyRIT (The Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI), an open-source toolkit to help researchers identify vulnerabilities in their own AI systems.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, security professionals face many challenges in protecting their organizations from cyber threats. One common problem is the persistence of attack surface blind spots, which can be exploited by attackers and prevent an organization’s ability to stay ahead of threats. For businesses that lack the resources or budget for a full-time, in-house security operations center (SOC) or that struggle to recruit and retain skilled staff, these blind spots can be even more challenging to address. Here are three tips to eliminate attack surface blind spots and strengthen your security posture.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>2024 ushered in significant changes for the healthcare industry. Industry-wide digital transformation, remote care expansion, increased merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as well as rapid AI adoption led to unprecedented growth of data and devices. Unfortunately, this increased reliance on health data also coincided with a surge in cyberattacks — 92% of healthcare organizations experienced a cyberattack in 2024. As Palo Alto Networks recently explored in our predictions for the next year, we expect that critical infrastructure sectors, such as healthcare, will face heightened risks with their significant IP and critical data repositories, making them attractive targets and more vulnerable to sophisticated disruptions.</p>
