		<p>Starting in December 2024, leading up to some of the busiest travel days, Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified a phishing campaign that impersonates online travel agency Booking.com and targets organizations in the hospitality industry. The campaign uses a social engineering technique called ClickFix to deliver multiple credential-stealing malware in order to conduct financial fraud and theft. As of February 2025, this campaign is ongoing.</p>
<p>This phishing attack specifically targets individuals in hospitality organizations in North America, Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, and Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western Europe, that are most likely to work with Booking.com, sending fake emails purporting to be coming from the agency.</p>

<p>To help users switching from Adobe PhotoShop, PhotoGIMP project updated today with support for the new GIMP 3.0 image editor.</p>
<p>PhotoGIMP is a free open-source project that optimizes GIMP for AdobeShop users. By changing the local app data, it organised the tools and their options to be PhotoShop style, assigned keyboard shortcuts to similar to the ones in Photoshop for Windows, following Adobe’s Documentation, and added new default settings to maximize space on the canvas.</p>

		<p>Cybersecurity is no longer optional—especially for companies in the automotive industry managing sensitive data. The <strong>Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX)</strong> provides a structured approach for organizations to standardize their security measures, ensuring compliance with industry expectations while mitigating the risks of breaches and data leaks.</p>

</p>
<p>For businesses looking to achieve <strong>TISAX certification</strong>, preparation is key. The process involves multiple levels of assessment and strict security requirements that align with ISO 27001 but extend to industry-specific concerns, such as prototype protection and data privacy.</p>
