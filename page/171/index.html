		<p><em>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Predicting 2025.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, seeing the &lsquo;Stargate&rsquo; rollout in the US, it seems that AI is far from stepping off the stage. Instead, we can expect significant developments in the ongoing scenario.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence, fondly known as AI, was first coined in 1956. It has taken decades to reach where we are today, but the next phase or wave of advancements will likely take drastically less time. At this point, we’ve explored the possibilities of AI in nearly every field, and now is the time to start implementing them strategically. It’s like getting comfortable in a car and finally taking it for drifts—&ldquo;the real ride,&rdquo; if you will.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve pulled off something really impressive with this series of Founders Edition cards.</p>
<p>With the launch of NVIDIA&rsquo;s RTX 50 series GPUs, as is tradition, we were introduced to a brand-new design for their signature &ldquo;Founders Edition&rdquo; cards. While brands like ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI and others will release their own designs a little while after the official launch, NVIDIA always releases their own take on reigning in the horsepower of their latest creation first in the form of a reference card.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the second day of Pwn2Own Automotive 2025. Yesterday, we awarded more than $380,000 for 16 unique 0-days - and we had several bug collisions as well. Today looks to be even better, with the WOLFBOX and Tesla EV chargers making their Pwn2Own debut. Here’s how the Master of Pwn standings look at the beginning of Day Two:</p>

<p>We’ll see how they look at the end of the day. Here are the Day Two results, which we will be updating throughout the competition.</p>

<p>If hacking on consumer hardware is about figuring out what it can do, and pushing it in directions that the manufacturer never dared to dream, then this is a very fine hack indeed. [Portasynthica3] takes on the Yamaha PSR-E433, a cheap beginner keyboard, discovers a shell baked into it, and takes it from there.</p>
<p>[Portasynthinca3] reverse engineered the firmware, wrote shellcode for the device, embedded the escape in a MIDI note stream, and even ended up writing some simple LCD driver software totally decent refresh rate on the dot-matrix display, all to support the lofty goal of displaying arbitrary graphics on the keyboard’s dot-matrix character display.</p>
