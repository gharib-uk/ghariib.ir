		<p>Need a beginner-friendly GUI that&rsquo;s laden with all the essential features to manage your containers? Portainer has your back!</p>
<p>Containers are perfect when you want to isolate your self-hosted services without the extra overhead of virtual machines.

Docker Desktop is a decent option, but it’s rather rudimentary in its functionality.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a different browser, see why I used Opera GX.</p>
<p>We all wish our browsers could do things better, but we generally stick to mainstream options like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge because we&rsquo;re stuck in their ecosystem and put faith in their abilities.

		<p>Ready to take your backups to the cloud? Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p>Storing data in the cloud using free or expensive subscriptions is one thing, but it&rsquo;s a whole different beast to store even more data in the long term. You could use Apple iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive for all your backups and data you don&rsquo;t need to frequently access, but when working with big data or cold storage, it&rsquo;s best to use a provider with the means to manage files for longer periods and provide the support and software to make your life easier. We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the best long-term cool and cold storage providers right here.</p>
