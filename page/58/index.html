		<p>Hardly a day goes by without a policy announcement or public statement by President Trump that betrays a nationalist instinct. The first problem with nationalism is semantics. People tend to confuse it with patriotism, a deeply felt emotion that a nationalist can easily stir with a discourse that equates love of country with hostility to the outside world and, domestically, to those presented as a threat to the nation. </p>
<p>Economic nationalists often emphasize the need to protect the nation from perceived threats rather than focusing on the alleged economic advantages of their policies. They argue that foreign countries are taking advantage of us or that a competitor’s dominance in areas like science, technology, or industry is an affront to our nation’s greatness. The latter can be seen when Trump points to Taiwan’s leadership in the chip industry. Taiwan’s leadership is only admissible if its companies make their semiconductors in the U.S.—under threat of reprisals if they don’t.</p>

<p><em><strong>Authored By Sakshi Jaiswal</strong></em> </p>
<p>McAfee Labs recently observed a surge in phishing campaigns that use fake viral video links to trick users into downloading malware. The attack relies on social engineering, redirecting victims through multiple malicious websites before delivering the payload. Users are enticed with promises of exclusive content, ultimately leading them to fraudulent pages and deceptive download links.  </p>

		<p>Sports betting is a multi-billion-dollar industry, but behind the flashing lights and promises of easy money lies a hidden underworld of deception.</p>
<p>In recent years, shady betting companies have found a clever way to bypass regulations and continue their operations through <strong>mirror sites</strong>—duplicate versions of their main website that allow them to evade bans, deceive users, and rake in massive profits. </p>
<h2 id="how-g-c-e-m-d"><strong>How</strong> <strong>g****ambling</strong> <strong>c****ompanies</strong> <strong>e****xploit</strong> <strong>m****irror</strong> <strong>d****omains</strong> </h2>
<p>A mirror site is essentially a clone of an existing betting website, hosted on a different domain. Companies create dozens – sometimes even hundreds – of these mirrors to ensure they remain accessible even when regulators try to shut them down. </p>

		<p>We’ve survived Pwn2Own Automotive and made it to the second Patch Tuesday of 2025. As always, Microsoft and Adobe have released their latest security patches. Take a break from your scheduled activities and join us as we review the details of their latest security alerts. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Patches for February 2025</strong></p>
<p>For February, Adobe released seven bulletins addressing 45 CVEs in Adobe InDesign, Commerce, Substance 3D Stager, InCopy, Illustrator, Substance 3D Designer, and Adobe Photoshop Elements. The largest by far is the update for Commerce with 31 CVEs addressed. While there are some cross-site scripting (XSS) bugs addressed, there are also some security feature bypasses and Critical-rated code execution bugs, too. The update for InDesign fixes seven bugs, four of which are rated Critical. The three bugs in Illustrator are also rated Critical and could lead to arbitrary code execution when opening a malicious file.</p>

		<p>Introduction In a report published by Statista, cybercrime cost the world over $9 trillion in 2024 and is predicted to rise to nearly $14 trillion by 2028. These figures are a deep source of worry for governments and private businesses about what’s next in the cyber threat landscape. The problem is that cyber threats are rising in both volume and scale. More so, the major threats are directed at emerging technologies, aiming to capitalize on weaknesses in emerging AI and ML systems. Cyber threats increasingly play a role in international conflicts, such as the recent reports of the “salt&hellip;</p>
