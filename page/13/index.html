		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-24981<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 6, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 50 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> MDC is a tool to take regular Markdown and write documents interacting deeply with a Vue component. In affected versions unsafe parsing logic of the URL from markdown can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code due to a bypass to the existing guards around the `javascript:` protocol scheme in the URL. The parsing logic implement in `props.ts` maintains a deny-list approach to filtering potential malicious payload. It does so by matching protocol schemes like `javascript:` and others. These security guards can be bypassed by an adversarial that provides JavaScript URLs with HTML entities encoded via hex string. Users who consume this library and perform markdown parsing from unvalidated sources could result in rendering vulnerable XSS anchor links. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.13.3 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 9.3 | CRITICAL<br>

		<p>A change may be coming in the way you&rsquo;ll be paying for Apple Care. Apple doesn&rsquo;t approve of an app that it has approved—semantics are at the heart of a porn app problem. DeepSeek is this past week&rsquo;s big artificial intelligence story. What&rsquo;s different about this new AI contender? Does it secure your data? And Apple&rsquo;s new Invites app doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too inviting.</p>

		<p>The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA, or CRA for short) is coming. I’ve talked about this piece of upcoming regulation in some depth before, having covered its background and stipulations in previous pieces on our website and for the Forbes Technology Council, and explored what it means for the businesses who consume open source in later articles (you can also read a version of this blog on Forbes). However, with the clock ticking and time running out to make your devices and software compliant with the Act’s new cybersecurity requirements, I thought I’d talk about how you should be approaching your device design and cybersecurity foundation. In this blog, I’ll run through a blueprint for cybersecurity, and outline what you should be doing to meet EU CRA compliance if you’re an IoT or device manufacturer. </p>
