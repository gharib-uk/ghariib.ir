<p>We recently released <a href="/blog/new-groups/">a new version of Signal groups</a> with group admins, @mentions, permissions, and more. Today we’re adding one more feature into the mix: group links, which let you quickly create a link that anyone can follow to join your group. Like our other new group features, you can create a new group to try it out now, but these features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups.</p>

<p>Signal has always benefitted from our engaged and supportive community, and wouldn’t be what it is without your input and feedback. As the number of people using Signal has grown, so have our efforts to keep pace with what people expect from a messaging app, and where we might find new opportunities for Signal.</p>

<p>A little over a year ago, I created a simple python script for sandboxing Rust development using Docker. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/mikecardwell/saferrust">saferrust</a>. You basically copy it into your PATH, name it “cargo” and pretend like you have the real cargo application installed. It pulls down the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/rust">latest offical Rust docker image from dockerhub</a>, mounts your CWD into it and then runs your cargo commands inside the docker container. I did this basically because I wanted to secure my homedir against potentially malicious packages on <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> during development. If you want to know more about it, <a href="https://gitlab.com/mikecardwell/saferrust">check out the project on gitlab</a>.</p>

<p>Now that voice and video calls are <a href="/blog/desktop-calling-beta">available for everyone</a> on Signal Desktop and iPad, in addition to our mobile clients, we want to share a closer look at the technology that makes it possible for incoming calls to ring across multiple devices. Every call placed on Signal has always been private and end-to-end encrypted, but we previously supported only calls to or from one primary device per person. Now, you can make and receive secure audio and video calls from the devices in your pocket, on your lap, or at your desk.</p>

As a general rule, I try to Dockerise all NodeJS applications, to isolate them from the host; I’ve become weary of third party modules on NPM. Secondly, I don’t want to run a NodeJS application as root in order to allow it to run iptables. Here’s how I managed it.</p>

<p>Whether it’s staying in touch with family and friends, planning a party, scheduling an event, getting work done, or <a href="/blog/blur-tools/">organizing for change</a>, group chats are an increasingly important part of Signal. Today we’re releasing a new version of Signal groups that gives you a richer private group experience with group admins, granular permissions, @mentions and more. If you’re excited to try out these features now, you can create a new group to do so. These features will be coming soon to your existing Signal groups in a future update.</p>

After its initial release, we asked ourselves if that is truly the limit of what we can achieve or could we pull off something incredible to mark the 25th anniversary of Hackers? What about “a second concurrent session as root”, “seamless desktop integration with Windows”, or - dare we dream - “sound”?</p>
