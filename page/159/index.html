		<p>The high-speed, low-latency data highway powering AMD&rsquo;s Ryzen CPUs</p>
<p>If you own an AMD Ryzen CPU and have done a Google search for information about RAM overclocking, speed, and stability in the last 7 years, chances are you might have come across something called the &ldquo;Infinity Fabric.&rdquo; Usually brought into discussions to explain the somewhat unique relationship of AMD CPUs with high-speed memory, Infinity Fabric is an internal interconnect bus that forms the core of AMD&rsquo;s scalable CPU architecture.</p>

		<p>A cybercriminal campaign linked to Russia is deploying QR codes to access the WhatsApp accounts of high-profile targets like journalists, members of think tanks, and employees of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), according to new details revealed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The group, which Microsoft tracks by the name “Star Blizzard,” is also referred to as Coldriver by other researchers. Last year, the group created impersonation accounts where members posed as experts in a field that their targets might be interested in—or that was somehow affiliated with the target. Once a relationship had been established, the target would receive a phishing link or a document that contained a phishing link.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>XBOOT: Free-XOR Gates for CKKS with Applications to Transciphering</strong><br>
<em>Chao Niu, Zhicong Huang, Zhaomin Yang, Yi Chen, Liang Kong, Cheng Hong, Tao Wei</em></p>
<p>The CKKS scheme is traditionally recognized for approximate homomorphic encryption of real numbers, but BLEACH (Drucker et al., JoC 2024) extends its capabilities to handle exact computations on binary or small integer numbers.</p>
<p>Despite this advancement, BLEACH&rsquo;s approach of simulating XOR gates via $(a-b)^2$ incurs one multiplication per gate, which is computationally expensive in homomorphic encryption. To this end, we introduce XBOOT, a new framework built upon BLEACH&rsquo;s blueprint but allows for almost free evaluation of XOR gates. The core concept of XBOOT involves lazy reduction, where XOR operations are simulated with the less costly addition operation, $a+b$, leaving the management of potential overflows to later stages. We carefully handle the modulus chain and scale factors to ensure that the overflows would be conveniently rounded during the CKKS bootstrapping phase without extra cost. We use AES-CKKS transciphering as a benchmark to test the capability of XBOOT, and achieve a throughput exceeding one kilobyte per second, which represents a $2.5times$ improvement over the state-of-the-art (Aharoni et al., HES 2023). Moreover, XBOOT enables the practical execution of tasks with extensive XOR operations that were previously challenging for CKKS. For example, we can do Rasta-CKKS transciphering at over two kilobytes per second, more than $10times$ faster than the baseline without XBOOT.</p>

		<p>Just remember to delete it before you submit your report.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that we reported on someone who got Tetris working in a PDF document. Of course, the next logical step was to get Doom running on it, which they managed to do. However, it turns out that the story doesn&rsquo;t end there. The feat inspired people to attempt to cram the classic FPS into as many productivity-based apps as possible, and now Microsoft Word has fallen victim to the Doom enthusiasts&rsquo; endless crusade to get it running on everything possible.</p>
