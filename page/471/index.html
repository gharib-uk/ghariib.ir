		<p>If you&rsquo;re a marketer in 2024, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone suggests a podcast. 😅 In fact, you might be working on your company&rsquo;s podcast right now, or listening to one as you cruise your inbox.</p>
<p>Well, here at Giant Swarm, we&rsquo;ve taken the podcast plunge ourselves. But our journey into the world of podcasting isn&rsquo;t your typical marketing strategy, or at least that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re telling ourselves. It&rsquo;s a story of experimentation and a genuine desire to connect in a more human way. Plus, it’s really fun to find a jingle on Fiverr each week… </p>

<p>As mentioned in our 2024 Roadmap and the v15 release blog, we’re excited to introduce our new TAXII server and the latest addition to the ATT&amp;CK Workbench software suite: the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 Server. We’ve open-sourced the TAXII 2.1 code on GitHub, allowing you to set up your own servers within your organization <em>and</em> contribute to its improvement.</p>
<p>While you’re diving into the new 2.1 server, don’t forget: our TAXII 2.0 server is retiring on <strong>December 18.</strong></p>

		<p>Amazon CloudWatch dashboards are customizable pages in the CloudWatch console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single view. This post focuses on deploying a CloudWatch dashboard that you can use to create a customizable monitoring solution for your AWS Network Firewall firewall. It’s designed to provide deeper insights into your firewall’s performance and security events simplifying security monitoring.</p>
<p>Network Firewall is a managed service that you can use to deploy essential network protections to Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs). Network Firewall provides comprehensive logs and metrics through CloudWatch, and we’re expanding its capabilities with this CloudWatch dashboard. This enhancement makes it easier to visualize, analyze, and act on the wealth of data generated by your firewall.</p>

		<p>Giant Swarm is all about making your platform engineering smarter. We deliver world-class runtime capability through our Kubernetes Cluster Fleet Management, built on Cluster API, while also providing the essential tools a good platform team needs to operate their platform as smooth as cheesecake.</p>
<p>One such essential is observability. Observability allows you to measure your system&rsquo;s current state by analyzing its vitals in different forms. Storing this data over time also gives you historical insights, allowing you to compare the current state with previous ones, which makes anomaly detection and general operations of your system way easier.</p>

<p>AWS is aware of CVE-2024-30164 and CVE-2024-30165 in AWS Client VPN. These issues could potentially allow an actor with access to an end user&rsquo;s device to escalate to root privilege and execute arbitrary commands on that device. We addressed these issues on all platforms. Customers using AWS Client VPN should upgrade to version 3.11.1 or higher for Windows, 3.9.2 or higher for MacOS, and 3.12.1 or higher for Linux.</p>

<p>Data.all is an open source development framework to help customers build a data marketplace on AWS.</p>
<p>We have identified the following issues within data.all version 1.0.0 through 2.6.0. On November 8, 2024, we released a fix and recommend customers upgrade to version 2.6.1 or later and ensure any forked or derivative code are patched to incorporate the new fixes.</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-52311 relates to an issue where data.all does not invalidate authentication token upon user logout.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-52312 relates to an issue where data.all authenticated users can perform restricted operations against DataSets and Environments.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-52313 relates to an issue where data.all authenticated users can obtain incorrect object level authorizations.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-52314 relates to an issue where data.all admin user may access potentially sensitive data stored by producers via logs.</li>
<li>CVE-2024-10953 relates to an issue where data.all authenticated users can perform mutating update operations on persisted notification records.</li>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>

<p>AWS is aware of CVE-2022-1471 in SnakeYaml software, included in DynamoDB local jar and Docker distributions from version 1.21 and version 2.0. If leveraged, this issue could allow an actor to perform remote code execution using the SnakeYaml&rsquo;s Constructor(), as the software does not restrict the types that can be instantiated during deserialization. AWS has found no evidence that this issue has been leveraged, however, customers should still take action. On November 6, 2024, we released a fix for this issue. Customers should upgrade DynamoDB local to the latest version: v1.25.1 and above, or 2.5.3 and above.</p>
