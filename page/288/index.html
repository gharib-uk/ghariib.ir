		<p>Academic digital credentials — the cryptographically verifiable assertion that an individual holds a degree, certificate, or other credential — have been available for the better part of a decade. Yet despite the potential value of these data-rich, transportable credentials to graduates, employers, and academic institutions, digital credentials have by no means become the standard in presenting or verifying skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>A new report from the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), housed at MIT Open Learning, explores this gap between the promise of digital credentials and their widespread adoption.</p>

<p>The post The 2023 Counter Ransomware Initiative Summit | Stepping Up Global Collaboration in Cybersecurity appeared first on SentinelOne DE.</p>
<p>Ransomware’s transformation from a targeted cybercrime to a significant threat to national security has increasingly drawn attention at international forums like the Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) Summit. The 2023 Summit, which brought together representatives from 50 countries, signifies a growing, yet cautious, acknowledgment of the need for collaborative strategies in tackling this complex issue.</p>

		<p>Think back to when your brand new laptop or desktop ran the smoothest, operating at peak performance. Is it still that fast, or does even the simplest task seem to take forever? Before you ditch your current PC, there’s a way to get it running like new again.</p>
<p>First things first, though—you have to understand why your PC is running slowly.</p>
<h2 id="do-computers-slow-down-with-age">Do computers slow down with age?</h2>
<p>If you’ve had your PC for a while, you might think it’s running slower because of aging hardware. But not even brand-new computers run at their optimal speed due to preinstalled bloatware.</p>

		<p>Over the last few weeks, security teams everywhere have been busy patching Log4J vulnerabilities. In this article we want to talk about the three things you can tell your friends why this is way worse.</p>
<h2 id="ubiquity">Ubiquity</h2>
<p>This vulnerability impacts impacts Java applications and those can be found almost anywhere: enterprise, vendor applications, database drivers, Android phones and even the smartchip on the credit card in your wallet (Java Card). Additionally, majority of Java applications use log4j to handle logging, often involving user input. While your phone is probably not exploitable, the sheer number of places where log4j can be hiding makes this is hard to fix.</p>

		<p>A firewall is a security system that is used to control network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to a network. It acts as a machinery between a private network and the internet, allowing only authorized traffic to go through. Firewalls have evolved from simple packet filters to modern Next-Generation Firewalls with advanced features. Firewalls can be hardware or software-based either commercial or open-source.</p>
<p>In today’s interconnected world, network security is crucial for any business. Hackers are constantly trying to breach company networks and steal valuable data. One essential tool in securing network infrastructure is a firewall. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules and parameters.</p>

		<p>It’s an exciting time to be a managed service provider (MSP). More than ever, small and medium businesses (SMBs) are looking to MSPs as trusted advisors to help safeguard them from today’s growing cyber threats. One of the services in high demand right now? Managed detection and response (MDR). When asked about their biggest growth drivers, MSPs cite addressing clients’ cybersecurity concerns and awareness as the top new-business drivers (54%).1</p>
