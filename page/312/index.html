		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Foundations of Platform-Assisted Auctions</strong><br>
<em>Hao Chung, Ke Wu, Elaine Shi</em></p>
<p>Today, many auctions are carried out with the help of intermediary platforms like Google and eBay. These platforms serve as a rendezvous point for the buyers and sellers, and charge a fee for its service. We refer to such auctions as platform-assisted auctions. Traditionally, the auction theory literature mainly focuses on designing auctions that incentivize the buyers to bid truthfully, assuming that the platform always faithfully implements the auction. In practice, however, the platforms have been found to manipulate the auctions to earn more profit, resulting in high-profile anti-trust lawsuits.</p>

<p>A 9×9 grid of LEGO shafts all turning in unison is just one of the non-trivial design challenges.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In principle the treadmill works by placing an object on a bed of identical, rotating discs. By tilting the discs, one controls which edge is in contact with the object, which in turn controls the direction the object moves. While the concept is straightforward, the implementation is a wee bit more complex. LEGO pieces offer a rich variety of mechanical functions, but even so, making a 9×9 array of discs all rotate in unison turns out to be a nontrivial problem to solve. Gears alone are not the answer, because the shafts in such a dense array are a bit too close for LEGO gears to play nicely.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction:</strong></h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s recent announcement of their Willow quantum processor marks a significant advancement in quantum computing technology while raising questions about the security and sustainability of current encryption methods. As quantum computers grow more powerful, cybersecurity experts grow increasingly concerned about their potential to break widely used encryption standards that protect sensitive data worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-vs-traditional-computing"><strong>Quantum vs. Traditional Computing:</strong></h2>
<p>Google’s Willow quantum processor is a leap forward in quantum computing capabilities, particularly in its approach to error correction and qubit stability. Unlike traditional computers that process information in bits (either 0s or 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in multiple states at the same time. Because of this, quantum computers can test millions of combinations simultaneously instead of one at a time. This fundamental difference allows quantum computers to solve certain types of problems exponentially faster than classical computers, including the mathematical problems that form the foundation of today&rsquo;s encryption standards. When tested, Willow performed a standard computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years - a number that exceeds the age of the universe (Google).</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 7, 2025</p>
<p>Data science technology is about to revolutionize even the most traditional industries as it uses AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data, according to a story in Medium.</p>
<p>Total global data storage is projected to exceed 200 zettabytes by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. This includes data stored on private and public IT infrastructures, on utility infrastructures, on private and public cloud data centers, and personal computing devices; PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and IoT devices</p>

		<p>One of the best things about working in quantum computing is being exposed to a whole new set of skills and tools. For those of us coming from the software engineering side, discovering the things our academic peers are using is an interesting experience. One of the best for me personally was coming across the Julia programming language, and learning why it has become the go-to language for serious scientific programming in some circles.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 23, 2024</p>
<p>Cyberattacks are as old as the internet, but over the past several years they have become more insidious and destructive, in part by harnessing social engineering at scale and deploying increasingly sophisticated technology like generative AI. This year, cybercrime is projected to cost an estimated $9.5 trillion across the globe, according to Cybersecurity Ventures — approximately 9 percent of the world’s GDP.</p>
