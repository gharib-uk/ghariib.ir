		<p>As January approaches and the year comes to a close, distinct changes in global Internet usage emerge.

		<p><strong>“You don’t want to think about security — until you have to.”</strong></p>
<p>That’s what I’d tell you if I were being honest about the state of development at most organizations I have spoken to. Every business out there is chasing one thing: speed. Move faster. Innovate faster. Ship faster. To them, speed is survival. There’s something these companies are not seeing — a shadow. An unseen risk hiding behind every shortcut, every unchecked tool, and every corner cut in the name of “progress.”</p>

		<p>Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions have long served as the indispensable nerve center for the security operations center (SOC). However, the SIEM landscape has undergone seismic shifts and market disruption in recent times, making it that much harder for chief information security officers (CISOs) to navigate and select the optimal SIEM for their needs.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The warning message indicates that the globally installed Angular CLI version in your system is greater than the locally installed one in the project. The problem is that the older version is being used because Angular CLI looks for the local version first when executing commands on a project. This version mismatch may cause incompatibility issues and errors such as the one you’re experiencing.</p>
<p>This tutorial will help you to resolve “Your global Angular CLI version is greater than your local version” issue in your Angular application.</p>
