<p>We were excited about our <a href="/blog/spring-break-of-code/">Spring Break Of Code announcement</a>, but the response was better than we anticipated: over 100 extremely impressive proposals from folks around the world who are passionate about pushing the envelope of security and privacy software. After reading all the proposals, we really wish we’d rented a bigger house.</p>

<p>In our <a href="/blog/low-latency-switching">previous post</a>, we discussed the global infrastructure that allows RedPhone clients to find low-latency servers when establishing a call. This post discusses the techniques we use to retain call quality when network conditions are less than ideal.</p>

<p>RedPhone is our mobile app for end-to-end encrypted voice calls. When we talk about RedPhone, we tend to emphasize the cryptography, and how using it can help keep your communications safe. What we don’t talk about as much is the VoIP application underneath all of that, which it turns out was actually the hard part.</p>

<p>This Spring will be the first Open Whisper Systems <em>Spring Break Of Code</em>, a week-long, expenses-paid retreat to Maui for folks who like software development, security, and the beach. We’ve rented a large beachfront house on the west coast of Maui for everyone to stay in, and will pay for your airfare. While there, you can split your time between island living and working on an Open Whisper Systems-related project that you propose.</p>

<p>Whisper Systems was a company focused on the development of mobile security software, which was acquired by Twitter in late 2011. Twitter very generously made some of the Whisper Systems software available under an Open Source license (GPLv3), which has since been under open development by the community. The software has seen a number of new releases based on that open development, and we’ve been calling the project for this continued work “Open Whisper Systems.” Welcome to the project’s new home.</p>
