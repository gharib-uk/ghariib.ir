	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In a troubling development for web publishers, numerous site owners are reporting dramatic drops in their Google AdSense earnings since early January 2025, with some seeing their monthly income plummet from comfortable four-figures to barely enough for a month&rsquo;s worth of instant noodles. This sudden downturn has left many content creators in crisis mode, particularly those relying on this income for student loan payments and basic living expenses.</p>
<h2 id="the-scale-of-the-problem">The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>The impact appears to be widespread across various niches, but particularly noticeable in the technology and educational content sectors. One CS student&rsquo;s story particularly stands out: after five years of building a programming tutorial site from their freshman year study notes, their monthly AdSense revenue crashed from $1,500 to $218 – just days before their $890 student loan payment was due, on this discussion about google adsense revenue drop in the very beginning of this year.</p>

With over 170 million American users and countless businesses relying on TikTok for engagement, marketing, and revenue, the platform has become a cornerstone of modern digital ecosystems. For developers and businesses, TikTok’s APIs offer a gateway to integrate its powerful functionalities into their applications, enabling enhanced user experiences and data-driven insights.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>React 19 brings a game-changing improvement with the <strong><code>use</code></strong> API, making data fetching and asynchronous operations in your components a breeze! 🚀 This new approach lets you write cleaner, more readable code by integrating directly with Suspense, eliminating the need for cumbersome lifecycle methods and extra state management. 😊</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The <strong><em>use</em></strong> API in React 19 simplifies <em>fetching data and working with asynchronous resources directly</em> within a component&rsquo;s render function. This eliminates the need for separate lifecycle methods or complex state management for loading and error states.</p>

		<p>Why buy a handheld when you can build one?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of SBC-related news for XDA, which makes it pretty hard for me to be truly blown away by a project. Fortunately, that only means that the ones that do amaze me are truly something stunning. Such is the case of this DIY OLED handheld, which uses an SBC to create a device you can feasibly build for yourself at home.</p>
