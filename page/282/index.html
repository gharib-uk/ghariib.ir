		<p>Security leaders continue to be under intense pressure. Increasingly, they are turning toward third parties for support and expertise as their cybersecurity woes become more dire and it becomes harder to recruit and retain talent.  This is reflected in the projected growth for cybersecurity services through 20281 (managed security services, managed detection and response, security consulting, and security professional services).</p>
<p>According to Gartner1, end-user spending for all security services will grow from $77.4 billion in 2024 to $116.9 billion in 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 percent. Managed detection and response (MDR) is forecasted to be the highest growth area of security services, with a projected 17.1 percent CAGR through 2028. This is in part due to the continued, acute need for support with threat monitoring, detection, and response. However, it’s also due to a growing need for help with risk identification, management and governance, exposure and vulnerability management, and incident readiness due to increasingly stringent requirements by regulators for reporting in these areas.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a step-by-step guide highlighting how to install Windows 11 on a new PC.</p>
<p>Building a new PC can be a fun but somewhat daunting process, especially if you&rsquo;re doing it for the first time. Even if you run into some challenges, it&rsquo;s usually worth it for the feeling of turning it on for the first time knowing you have a faster (presumably) better experience waiting for you. Then there&rsquo;s that moment when you realize you still have to install an operating system, such as Windows 11.</p>
