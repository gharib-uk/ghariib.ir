	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a <code>strict-cpu-reservation</code> option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-feature">Understanding the feature</h2>
<p>The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The <code>reservedSystemCPUs</code> defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page.</p>

		<p>As we get closer to the release date for Kubernetes v1.32, the project develops and matures. Features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with better ones for the project&rsquo;s overall health.</p>
<p>This blog outlines some of the planned changes for the Kubernetes v1.32 release, that the release team feels you should be aware of, for the continued maintenance of your Kubernetes environment and keeping up to date with the latest changes. Information listed below is based on the current status of the v1.32 release and may change before the actual release date.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager.</p>
<p>As part of kubelet&rsquo;s workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods <strong>one by one</strong>. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes.</p>
<p>Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a scheduling context element named <em>QueueingHint</em>. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Canonical is continuously hiring new talent. Being a remote- first company, Canonical’s new joiners receive a unique onboarding experience. In their first weeks, they are introduced to the different departments and the various tools they use to work asynchronously across the globe. New hires develop a good understanding of the open-source technologies that the company deploys and supports such as Openstack, Kubernetes, Kubeflow and OpenSearch – in addition of course to Ubuntu, the world’s most famous OS, which they install on their laptops. </p>

<p>Generally, the projects featured on Hackaday actually <em>do</em> something. We won’t go as far as to say they are practical creations, but they usually have some kind of function other than to sit there and blink. But what if just sitting still and blinking away randomly is precisely what you want a piece of hardware to do?</p>
<p>That was exactly the goal when [createscifi] set out to dress a Lite Brite up as a futuristic prop. On a technical level, this project is pretty much as simple as it gets. But we appreciated seeing some of the techniques brought to bear on this project, and perhaps more importantly, really like the channel’s overall goal of creating affordable sci-fi props using common components. We don’t plan on filming our own space epic anytime soon…but we like to know the option is there.</p>

		<p><em>We’re embarking on an expedition through the archives of Giant Swarm’s blog.</em> </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re dusting off our virtual time machines and donning our trusty Sherlock hats (aka looking at old links 😀) to decode the mysteries hidden within our old blog posts. But hold on, this isn&rsquo;t a mere nostalgia trip; we&rsquo;re on a quest to uncover nuggets of wisdom and bring back some forgotten treasures. In a world that hurtles forward at lightning speed, it&rsquo;s all too easy to forget the paths we&rsquo;ve walked. As we wander down memory lane, we&rsquo;ll catch glimpses of our growth and witness the winds of change that have shaped our journey. </p>

		<p>So there’s been a fair bit of noise this past week about the Mac OS X Ransomware, the first of its’ kind called KeRanger. It also happens to be the first popular Mac malware of any form for some time. It’s also a lesson to all the Apple fanbois that their OS is not impervious […]</p>
