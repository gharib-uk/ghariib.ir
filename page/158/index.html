<em>Jaehyung Kim</em></p>
<p>As Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation over encrypted data, it is a natural question of how efficiently it handles standard integer computations like $64$-bit arithmetic. It has long been believed that the CGGI/DM family or the BGV/BFV family are the best options, depending on the size of the parallelism. The Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, although being widely used in many applications like machine learning, was not considered a good option as it is more focused on computing real numbers rather than integers.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Fair Signature Exchange</strong><br>
<em>Hossein Hafezi, Aditi Partap, Sourav Das, Joseph Bonneau</em></p>
<p>We introduce the concept of Fair Signature Exchange (FSE). FSE enables a client to obtain signatures on multiple messages in a fair manner: the client receives all signatures if and only if the signer receives an agreed-upon payment. We formalize security definitions for FSE and present a practical construction based on the Schnorr signature scheme, avoiding computationally expensive cryptographic primitives such as SNARKs. Our scheme imposes minimal overhead on the Schnorr signer and verifier, leaving the signature verification process unchanged from standard Schnorr signatures. Fairness is enforced using a blockchain as a trusted third party, while exchanging only a constant amount of information on-chain regardless of the number of signatures exchanged. We demonstrate how to construct a batch adaptor signature scheme using FSE, and our FSE construction based on Schnorr results in an efficient implementation of a batch Schnorr adaptor signature scheme for the discrete logarithm problem. We implemented our scheme to show that it has negligible overhead compared to standard Schnorr signatures. For instance, exchanging $2^{10}$ signatures on the Vesta curve takes approximately $80$ms for the signer and $300$ms for the verifier, with almost no overhead for the signer and $2$x overhead for the verifier compared to the original Schnorr protocol. Additionally, we propose an extension to blind signature exchange, where the signer does not learn the messages being signed. This is achieved through a natural adaptation of blinded Schnorr signatures.</p>

<p>Back in 2020, we first brought you word of the Xiaomi LYWSD03MMC — a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) temperature and humidity sensor that could be had from the usual sources for just a few dollars each. Capable of being powered by a single CR2032 battery for up to a year, the devices looked extremely promising for DIY smart home projects. There was only one problem, you needed to use Xiaomi’s app to read the data off of the things.</p>
<p>Enter [Aaron Christophel], who created an open source firmware for these units that could easily be flashed using a web-based tool from a smartphone in BLE range and opened up all sorts of advanced features. The firmware started getting popular, and a community developed around it. Everyone was happy. So naturally, years later, Xiaomi wants to put a stop to it.</p>
<p>The good news is, [Aaron] and [pvvx] (who has worked on expanding the original custom firmware and bringing it to more devices) have found a workaround that opens the devices back up. But the writing is on the wall, and there’s no telling how long it will be until Xiaomi makes another attempt to squash this project.</p>
<p>We can’t imagine why the company is upset about an extremely popular replacement firmware for their hardware. Unquestionably, Xiaomi has sold more of these sensors thanks to the work of [Aaron] and [pvvx]. This author happens to have over a dozen of them all over the house, spitting out data in a refreshingly simple to parse format. Then again, the fact that you could use the devices without going through their software ecosystem probably means they lose out on the chance to sell your data to the highest bidder…so there’s that.</p>
<p>The duo aren’t releasing any information on how their new exploit works, which will hopefully buy them some time before Xiaomi figures out how to patch it. In the short video below, [Aaron] shows the modified installation process that works on the newer official firmware. Unfortunately you now have to connect each unit up to the Xiaomi app before you can wipe it and install the open firmware, but it’s still better than the alternative.</p>

<p>What’s Forgotten Internet? It is the story of parts of the Internet — or Internet precursors — that you might have forgotten about or maybe you missed out on them. This time, we’re looking at Unix-to-Unix Copy, more commonly called UUCP. Developed in the late 1970s, UUCP was a solution for sending messages between systems that were not always connected together. It could also allow remote users to execute commands. By 1979, it was part of the 7th Edition of Unix.</p>
