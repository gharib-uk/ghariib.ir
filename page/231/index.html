		<p>The FBI says it has removed PlugX malware from thousands of infected computers worldwide.</p>
<p>The move came after suspicion that cybercriminals groups under control of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) used a version of PlugX malware to control, and steal information from victims’ computers.</p>
<p>PlugX has been around since at least 2008 but is under constant development. With the remote access it provides criminals, it is often used to spy on users and plant additional malware on interesting systems.</p>

	<div>
		<p>At Amazon Web Services (AWS), the security of our customers’ data is our top priority, and it always will be. Recently, the AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) and our automated security monitoring systems identified an increase in unusual encryption activity associated with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.</p>
<p>Working with customers, our security teams detected an increase of data encryption events in S3 that used an encryption method known as <em>server-side encryption using client-provided keys (SSE-C)</em>. While this is a feature used by many customers, we detected a pattern where a large number of S3 <code>CopyObject</code> operations using SSE-C began to overwrite objects, which has the effect of re-encrypting customer data with a new encryption key. Our analysis uncovered that this was being done by malicious actors who had obtained valid customer credentials, and were using them to re-encrypt objects.</p>

<em>Nirajan Koirala, Jonathan Takeshita, Jeremy Stevens, Sam Martin, Taeho Jung</em></p>
<p>In various real-world situations, a client may need to verify whether specific data elements they possess are part of a set segmented among numerous data holders. To maintain user privacy, it’s essential that both the client’s data elements and the data holders’ sets remain encrypted throughout the process. Existing approaches like Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT), and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) face challenges in these contexts. They either require data holders to access the sets in plaintext, result in high latency when aggregating data from multiple holders, risk exposing the identity of the party with the matching element, cause a large communication overhead for multiple-element queries, or lead to high false positives.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>PunSearch: Enabling Puncturable Encrypted Search over Lattice for Cloud Storage Systems</strong><br>
<em>Yibo Cao, Shiyuan Xu, Gang Xu, Xiu-Bo Chen, Tao Shang, Yuling Chen, Zongpeng Li</em></p>
<p>Searchable encryption (SE) has been widely studied for cloud storage systems, allowing data encrypted search and retrieval. However, existing SE schemes can not support the fine-grained searchability revocation, making it impractical for real applications. Puncturable encryption (PE) [Oakland'15] can revoke the decryption ability of a data receiver for a specific message, which can potentially alleviate this issue. Moreover, the threat of quantum computing remains an important and realistic concern, potentially leading to data privacy leakage for cloud storage systems. Consequently, designing a post-quantum puncturable encrypted search scheme is still far-reaching. In this paper, we propose PunSearch, the first puncturable encrypted search scheme over lattice for outsourced data privacy-preserving in cloud storage systems. PunSearch provides a fine-grained searchability revocation while enjoying quantum safety. Different from existing PE schemes, we construct a novel trapdoor generation mechanism through evaluation algorithms and lattice pre-image sampling technique. We then design a search permission verification method to revoke the searchability for specific keywords. Furthermore, we formalize a new IND-Pun-CKA security model, and utilize it to analyze the security of PunSearch. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that the computational overheads of Encrypt, Trapdoor, Search, and Puncture algorithms in PunSearch are just 0.06, 0.005, 0.05, and 0.31 times of other prior arts, respectively under the best cases. These results demonstrate that PunSearch is effective and secure for cloud storage systems.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ransomware">What is Ransomware?</h2>
<p>Ransomware is a malicious application that locks a person’s data, which is impossible to access until they pay money. Cybercriminals get into systems through phishing emails, software weaknesses, or more sophisticated techniques such as session hijacking.</p>

<p>Ransomware is more of a threat in 2024 compared to the present. Such attacks are becoming more frequent, and so is their complexity. Moreover, the cost of such attacks is increasing. Here are some vital facts and insights about this looming threat:</p>
