	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Internal Load Balancer (ILB) is now generally available (GA) for all DigitalOcean customers. Earlier this year, on October 17, we announced early access (EA) to Internal Load Balancer, one of our latest Networking feature releases. October 17 was a while ago, so here is a refresher on Internal Load Balancer (ILB):</p>
<h2 id="what-is-digitalocean-internal-load-balancer">What is DigitalOcean Internal Load Balancer?</h2>
<p>DigitalOcean Internal Load Balancer (ILB) is a regional load balancing solution designed to help facilitate more secure and efficient routing of internal traffic for private workloads. Unlike public-facing load balancers, the ILB operates within a private network, using private IP addresses to distribute HTTP, TCP, or UDP traffic across resources like Droplets and Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters. This helps to ensure that traffic remains isolated from the public internet, enhancing security and performance.</p>

	<div>
		<p>At DigitalOcean, we’re dedicated to making cloud infrastructure easy and accessible to developers everywhere. In effort of this and to support our global community, we are thrilled to announce that DigitalOcean now accepts Alipay as a payment method for any and all DigitalOcean services and products. This addition will help to enable more customers, especially those in Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions, to conveniently pay for cloud computing services on our platform.</p>

	<h1><a href="https://ghariib.ir/posts/digitalocean-vpc-peering-is-now-generally-available-ga-with-more-updates-to-enhance-the-networking-experience/">&lt;div&gt;DigitalOcean VPC Peering is Now Generally Available (GA), with More Updates to Enhance the Networking Experience&lt;/div&gt;</a></h1>
	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Peering is now generally available for all DigitalOcean customers. After our early access launch on October 16, we’ve enhanced VPC Peering with two major updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ability to create VPC-native DOKS clusters via the UI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to add Pod and service networks as trusted sources for databases</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-these-updates-will-benefit-your-networking-environment">How these updates will benefit your networking environment</h2>
<p><strong>VPC-native DOKS cluster creation via the UI</strong></p>
<p>By enabling direct VPC-native cluster creation, you gain more control over your networking configurations. DOKS clusters now inherit the security and isolation benefits of a designated VPC from the moment it’s created, eliminating the need for manual configuration, reducing complexity, and saving time.</p>

		<p><em>This blog post was originally published on The New Stack by Ninad Desai, Staff Site Reliability Engineer at InfraCloud.</em></p>
<p>Microservices have become the go-to approach for building scalable and resilient applications — mainly in the cloud native world. However, the increased complexity of managing communication between these distributed components has given rise to a powerful solution known as service mesh. As a dedicated infrastructure layer, a service mesh provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to streamline and secure interservice communication.</p>

		<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) workloads continue to grow in complexity and scale, the need for powerful and efficient computational resources becomes more critical. Running workloads on Kubernetes allows you to leverage the scalability and self-healing capabilities, however, there are challenges when it comes to managing and optimizing GPU resources. This is where the GPU Operators and plugins step in. They provide a solution to deploy and manage GPUs in Kubernetes.</p>
