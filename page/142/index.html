	<div>
		<p>Apple has released a host of security updates across many devices, including for a zero-day bug which is being actively exploited in iOS.</p>
<p>Apple said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A malicious application may be able to elevate privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Devices affected are those that run:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>iPhone XS and later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 7th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Asynchronous YOSO a la Paillier</strong><br>
<em>Ivan Bjerre Damgård, Simon Holmgaard Kamp, Julian Loss, Jesper Buus Nielsen</em></p>
<p>We present the first complete asynchronous MPC protocols for the YOSO (You Speak Only Once) setting. Our protocols rely on threshold additively homomorphic Paillier encryption and are adaptively secure. We rely on the paradigm of Blum et al. (TCC `20) in order to recursively refresh the setup needed for running future steps of YOSO MPC, but replace any use of heavy primitives such as threshold fully homomorphic encryption in their protocol with more efficient alternatives. In order to obtain an efficient YOSO MPC protocol, we also revisit the consensus layer upon which our protocol is built. To this end, we present a novel total-order broadcast protocol with subquadratic communication complexity in the total number $M$ of parties in the network and whose complexity is optimal in the message length. This improves on recent work of Banghale et al. (ASIACRYPT `22) by giving a simplified and more efficient broadcast extension protocol for the asynchronous setting that avoids the use of cryptographic accumulators.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>If your API security isn’t airtight, your entire operation is a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>Why? Well, hackers aren&rsquo;t guessing passwords; they’re exploiting weak authentication and wide-open authorization doors (which are some of the most common functions of APIs).</p>
<p>This is where you either tighten your defenses or become vulnerable. Mastering authentication and authorization isn&rsquo;t optional—it’s survival. This guide explains how to lock down your APIs, protect user data, and keep your systems bulletproof in a world where digital threats never sleep.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>AWS Firewall Manager is a powerful tool that organizations can use to define common AWS WAF rules with centralized security policies. These policies specify which accounts and resources are in scope. Firewall Manager creates a web access control list (web ACL) that adheres to the organization’s policy requirements and associates it with the in-scope resources. Figure 1 shows a Firewall Manager security policy and web ACL created in each in-scope account.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A detailed walkthrough demonstrates how attackers can manipulate Azure Key Vault’s access policies after compromising Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) credentials.</p>
<p>According to Faran Siddiqui, a penetration tester report, a “Key Vault 06 – Abuse Decryption Key,” shed light on this critical vulnerability and the technique involving AzureAD CLI and Microsoft Graph API.</p>
<p>The breakdown stems from “Key Vault 06 – Abuse Decryption Key,” a security lab scenario focused on helping red team testers and penetration testers understand potential threats in the Azure Key Vault ecosystem.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Can you imagine a modern working world without Software-as-a-Service ( SaaS) applications? Productivity, communication, and project management solutions have transformed the modern workplace, enabling hybrid and remote working, helping to cut costs, and offering unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Without them, the business world would grind to a halt. But these applications, like anything connected to the internet, are vulnerable to cyber threats. Part of the problem is that SaaS providers are responsible for securing SaaS infrastructure, platforms, and application&hellip;</p>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new malware campaign that leverages fake CAPTCHA verification checks to deliver the infamous Lumma information stealer.</p>
<p>“The campaign is global, with Netskope Threat Labs tracking victims targeted in Argentina, Colombia, the United States, the Philippines, and other countries around the world,” Leandro Fróes, senior threat research engineer at Netskope Threat Labs, said in a report shared with The Hacker News.</p>
<p>“The campaign also spans multiple industries, including healthcare, banking, and marketing, with the telecom industry having the highest number of organizations targeted.”</p>

<p>I was fascinated by the idea of jet packs when I was a kid. They were sci-fi magic, and the idea that you could strap into an oversized backpack wrapped in tinfoil and fly around was very enticing. Better still was when I learned that these things weren’t powered by complicated rockets but by plain hydrogen peroxide, which violently decomposes into water and oxygen when it comes in contact with a metal like silver or platinum. Of course I ran right to the medicine cabinet to fetch a bottle of peroxide to drip on a spoon from my mother’s good silverware set. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed by the results.</p>
