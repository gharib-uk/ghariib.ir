	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Broadcom disclosed a critical vulnerability affecting its Avi Load Balancer product.</p>
<p>The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-22217, is an unauthenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability that could allow attackers with network access to execute specially crafted SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to the underlying database.</p>
<p>The issue was privately reported to VMware and has been classified with a CVSSv3 base score of 8.6, placing it in the “Important” severity range.</p>
<p>The vulnerability arises from improper input sanitization in the Avi Load Balancer, enabling attackers to exploit the system without authentication.</p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s cloud-native world, applications need to handle fluctuating traffic efficiently. Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) helps by <strong>automatically scaling pods</strong> based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Why It Matters Now?</strong></p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Cost Efficiency</strong> – Avoid over-provisioning and reduce cloud bills.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Performance Optimization</strong> – Ensures smooth user experience under high loads.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Automation &amp; Flexibility</strong> – Dynamically adjusts based on real-time demand.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> If your Kubernetes apps need <strong>scalability, resilience, and cost control</strong>, HPA is a must-have!</p>

<p>For many people of a certain age, the DEC VAX was the first computer they ever used. They were everywhere, powerful for their day, and relatively affordable for schools and businesses. These minicomputers were smaller than the mainframes of their day, but bigger than what we think of as a computer today. So even if you could find an old one in working order, it would be a lot more trouble than refurbishing, say, an old Commodore 64. But if you want to play on a VAX, you might want to get a free membership on DECUServe, a service that will let you remotely access a VAX in all its glory.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since 2022, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) has been tracking multiple cyber espionage operations conducted by China-nexus actors utilizing <strong>POISONPLUG.SHADOW</strong>. These operations employ a custom obfuscating compiler that we refer to as &ldquo;<strong>ScatterBrain</strong>,&rdquo; facilitating attacks against various entities across Europe and the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. ScatterBrain appears to be a substantial evolution of ScatterBee, an obfuscating compiler <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/research/chasing-shadows.html">previously analyzed by PWC</a>.</p>
