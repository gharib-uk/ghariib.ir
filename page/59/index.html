		<p>We’ve reached the third Patch Tuesday of 2025, and, as expected, Microsoft and Adobe have released their latest security offerings. Take a break from your scheduled activities and join us as we review the details of their latest security alerts. If you’d rather watch the full video recap covering the entire release, you can check it out here:</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Patches for March 2025</strong></p>
<p>For March, Adobe released seven bulletins addressing 37 CVEs in Adobe Acrobat Reader, Substance 3D Sampler, Illustrator, Substance 3D Painter, InDesign, Substance 3D Modeler, and Substance 3D Designer. Six of these bugs were reported through the ZDI program. The patch for Reader contains fixes for multiple Critical-rated code execution bugs. This should be the top priority for deployment. The fix for Illustrator also corrects some Critical-rated code execution bugs. That also holds true for the InDesign patch. For all of the products, an attacker would need to convince a user to open a specially crafted file.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Security Score as the New Benchmark</strong> – A real-time metric that measures an organization’s adherence to security best practices within the Microsoft ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Procurement &amp; Supply Chain Impact</strong> – Businesses will soon require minimum security scores for contracts, third-party risk assessments, and vendor selection.</li>
<li><strong>Competitive Advantage &amp; Business Growth</strong> – Companies with high scores will use security as a differentiator, boosting marketability, M&amp;A prospects, and investor confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trustwave has engaged with hundreds of enterprise customers across Australia and worldwide, and one overarching theme continues to emerge. Cybersecurity is no longer an IT problem; it is a core business concern.</p>

		<p>The ability to anticipate and mitigate disruptions is more critical than ever. Organizations that lack a structured approach to assessing operational risks may find themselves vulnerable to financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.</p>
<p>A <strong>Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</strong> is a cornerstone of business continuity planning, helping organizations identify critical functions, assess vulnerabilities, and allocate resources effectively to maintain operational resilience. This article explores the importance of BIA, its key benefits, and how organizations can leverage it to enhance preparedness against disruptions.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Mar. 7, 2025</p>
<p>Forbes Technology Council Member Aliasgar Dohadwala points out that for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the consequences of ransomware can be catastrophic, with 60 percent of small businesses shutting their doors within six months of a major cyberattack, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.</p>
<p>Why are SMEs targeted? Dohadwala, a Board Member at the Dubai Chamber of Commerce Cybersecurity Group, offers 3 reasons in his Forbes article:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Cyberthreats are evolving at an alarming rate, thanks to cybercriminals’ use of advanced technologies, like AI, to develop more sophisticated attacks that no one has ever seen before. Today, we’re seeing attackers leveraging automation, artificial intelligence and adaptive malware to exfiltrate data in ways that bypass standard detection mechanisms (i.e., security solutions that focus only on perimeter defenses).</p>
<p>One example of the latest tactics bad actors are using is called <em>Relayed Data Exfiltration via HTTP Headers</em>. This type of attack uses stealthy siphoning techniques to steal sensitive business data, customer information or intellectual property without triggering alarms. Unlike brute-force cyberattacks that immediately lock systems, these attacks are like a slow drip of stolen data.</p>

		<p>In a statistical report published in September 2024 by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it was revealed that more than US$55 billion was lost to business email compromise (BEC) attacks between October 2013 and December 2023. This profitability drives attackers to further their techniques and adapt to security filters.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If your website is targeting multiple states or countries, by default, you face a double-pronged challenge: adapting to regional regulatory demands while defending against sophisticated cyber threats. Tackling this requires localization. But what does the term actually entail? Localization isn’t just about tailoring products, services, and infrastructure to meet local market requirements; it has emerged as a critical tool for compliance and cybersecurity threat mitigation. Strategic localization can address supply chain vulnerabilities, enhance regional threat intelligence, and foster&hellip;</p>

<p>Cyber threats are evolving at an exceptional pace, making security incident response more critical than ever for organizations worldwide. With the increasing cyberattacks, relying solely on traditional defense mechanisms is no longer sufficient. Organizations need a proactive approach that incorporates real-time threat intelligence to enhance their security posture and minimize the impact of potential breaches.</p>
<p>Threat intelligence plays a pivotal role in security incident response by providing actionable insights into emerging threats, attack patterns, and potential vulnerabilities. This intelligence-driven approach not only reduces the time required to detect and respond to threats but also strengthens an organization’s overall resilience against cyberattacks.</p>
