		<p>Over the last few weeks, security teams everywhere have been busy patching Log4J vulnerabilities. In this article we want to talk about the three things you can tell your friends why this is way worse.</p>
<h2 id="ubiquity">Ubiquity</h2>
<p>This vulnerability impacts impacts Java applications and those can be found almost anywhere: enterprise, vendor applications, database drivers, Android phones and even the smartchip on the credit card in your wallet (Java Card). Additionally, majority of Java applications use log4j to handle logging, often involving user input. While your phone is probably not exploitable, the sheer number of places where log4j can be hiding makes this is hard to fix.</p>

		<p>A firewall is a security system that is used to control network traffic and prevent unauthorized access to a network. It acts as a machinery between a private network and the internet, allowing only authorized traffic to go through. Firewalls have evolved from simple packet filters to modern Next-Generation Firewalls with advanced features. Firewalls can be hardware or software-based either commercial or open-source.</p>
<p>In today’s interconnected world, network security is crucial for any business. Hackers are constantly trying to breach company networks and steal valuable data. One essential tool in securing network infrastructure is a firewall. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules and parameters.</p>

		<p>It’s an exciting time to be a managed service provider (MSP). More than ever, small and medium businesses (SMBs) are looking to MSPs as trusted advisors to help safeguard them from today’s growing cyber threats. One of the services in high demand right now? Managed detection and response (MDR). When asked about their biggest growth drivers, MSPs cite addressing clients’ cybersecurity concerns and awareness as the top new-business drivers (54%).1</p>

		<p>The managed service provider (MSP) industry is booming with opportunities. At the same time, MSPs face the challenge of balancing customer satisfaction with profitability, making strategic decisions more important than ever. For 35% of MSPs, building cyber resiliency for customers is a top strategic priority, but that goal often runs up against resource constraints and rising operational costs.[i] To stay competitive, MSPs are focusing on improving operational efficiency (35%) and keeping costs under control (33%).[ii]</p>

		<p>The most recent email you sent was likely encrypted using a tried-and-true method that relies on the idea that even the fastest computer would be unable to efficiently break a gigantic number into factors.</p>
<p>Quantum computers, on the other hand, promise to rapidly crack complex cryptographic systems that a classical computer might never be able to unravel. This promise is based on a quantum factoring algorithm proposed in 1994 by Peter Shor, who is now a professor at MIT.</p>

<p>We are deeply intuitively familiar with our everyday physical world, so it was perhaps a bit of a surprise when researchers discovered a blind spot in our intuitive physical reasoning: it seems humans are oddly terrible at judging knot strength.</p>

<p>One example is the reef knot (top) vs. the grief knot (bottom). One is considerably stronger than the other.</p>

		<p>At Tuta our focus is to keep our users&rsquo; data secure with quantum-safe encryption. To achieve maximum security, the importance of strong, secure passwords that are long enough cannot be overstated. Passwords are the first line of defense to make sure that no unauthorized access can bring harm to your data or yourself. While factors like complexity and unpredictability matter, experts emphasize that length is a critical element in ensuring password security. But do people today know the perfect password length?</p>

		<p>Businesses face myriad cybersecurity risks, from phishing to unauthorized access of proprietary information. While restricting access rights and maintaining strict security measures can help, potential insider threats are always a risk.</p>
<p>Organizations must effectively monitor for signs of insider threats to prevent financial loss or the compromise of critical assets. Creating an insider threat program to raise awareness and mitigate insider threat risks is an excellent step toward going beyond standard security against external attacks.</p>

		<p>If you&rsquo;re anything like us, your calendar app is your lifeline, and by the way, a private one. It&rsquo;s where you organize everything—from work meetings to social gatherings—and sometimes, it feels like your entire life is neatly packed into those little squares. But, let’s be honest, even the most feature-packed calendar apps can get a little overwhelming. That’s why today, we are excited to talk about a small but mighty UI improvement that will make how you interact with your calendar way faster: a simplified event creation flow.</p>
