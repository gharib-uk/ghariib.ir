		<p>The energy sector is the cornerstone of modern infrastructure, powering essential services and supporting the daily operations of economies worldwide. However, it also faces unique cybersecurity challenges, particularly in complying with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation&rsquo;s Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) standards. Cyber threats keep growing in sophistication and frequency and the sector&rsquo;s critical assets—such as power grids, pipelines, and renewable energy networks—face unprecedented risk.

		<p>Nearly half (45%) of developers say they don’t have enough time for learning and development, according to a developer experience research study by Harness and Wakefield Research. Additionally, developer onboarding is a slow and painful process, with 71% of executive buyers saying that onboarding new developers takes at least two months. </p>
<p>To accelerate innovation and bring products to market faster, organizations must empower developers with robust support and intuitive guardrails, enabling them to succeed within a structured yet flexible environment. That’s where Docker fits in: We help developers onboard quickly and help organizations set up the right guardrails to give developers the flexibility to innovate within the boundaries of company policies. </p>

	<b><time>22.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) makes building and managing appliances easier than ever. Image mode uses a magical technology known as bootc to house the entire operating system (OS) in a container, making it possible to boot the container on virtually any type of system. </p>
<p>This article explores how image mode helps overcome many of the historic challenges that have plagued software appliances and further demonstrates how it accelerates creation and lowers maintenance costs over the life of the appliance. We’ll cover the topics of containers and bootable containers. You can check out our product docs for more information. Whether you are creating an external product/service for end users or providing a similar experience for internal customers, this article is for you (Figure 1).</p>
