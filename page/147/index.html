<p>Kodi, the popular free open-source home theater software, released new 21.2 version today with many improvements and tons of bug-fixes.</p>
<p>First, the new Kodi 21.2 features <strong>significant speed increase of library scans</strong> (back to v20 level) as well as faster artwork caching.</p>

</p>
<p>For Linux users, the new release enabled/fixed HDR to SDR tone mapping on video sources with partial or missing display metadata, fixed HDR passthrough for HDR videos that didn’t switch TV into HDR mode, and fixed issue that windowed Kodi doubled in size on every start when using Wayland with a scaling factor &gt; 100%.</p>

		<p>The productivity suite is now out of Office.</p>
<p>Back in December, Microsoft gave out a small warning. It stated that it planned to rebrand its entire productivity line from &ldquo;Microsoft 365 Office&rdquo; to &ldquo;Microsoft 365 Copilot,&rdquo; and people didn&rsquo;t really gel with the idea. Well, seems Microsoft didn&rsquo;t really care, as it has given the green light to begin rebranding everyone&rsquo;s apps to a more Copilot-focused brand.</p>

		<p>I am always interested in new phishing tricks, and watching them spread across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>A few days ago I started getting phishing SMS messages with a new twist. They were standard messages about delayed packages or somesuch, with the goal of getting me to click on a link and entering some personal information into a website. But because they came from unknown phone numbers, the links did not work. So—this is the new bit—the messages said something like: “Please reply Y, then exit the text message, reopen the text message activation link, or copy the link to Safari browser to open it.”&hellip;</p>

<p>Kubernetes has become an enterprise’s go-to platform for orchestrating and managing container workloads for cloud-native software. As more organizations adopt it and cloud-native software scales and becomes more complex, the need for container security is high. Kubernetes and container workloads have become a prime enterprise attack surface—67% of organizations delayed or slowed down deployment due to Kubernetes security concerns. There are numerous choices for container security. What sets Check Point CloudGuard apart? Its unique two-axes defense-in-depth approach scans, protects, and detects across an enterprise’s entire container environment. Think of it like this: one axis spans the software development lifecycle (SDLC), […]</p>

		<p>Intel is the one to watch in the GPU scene.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such an odd time to be an Intel fan. The company continues to struggle with its desktop CPUs but Lunar Lake mobile processors and Arc discrete graphics cards have been largely well received. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Intel&rsquo;s push into the affordable GPU market segment, offering gamers excellent value with Battlemage GPUs for less than $250. The latest addition to the family is the Intel Arc B570, a 1080p and 1440p GPU for $219, seriously undercutting some of the offerings from direct competitors. It&rsquo;s a great time to be a PC gamer as Intel looks to break up the GPU duopoly and here&rsquo;s why these cards will be a sleeper hit for desktop systems.</p>

		<p>Crafting a PC with a unique aesthetic might have become harder, but it&rsquo;s not impossible</p>
<p>Ask a PC builder whether they care about performance or looks, and they&rsquo;ll probably answer &ldquo;both.&rdquo; Building a PC that looks unique, however, is easier said than done. Since everyone usually builds with the same overused components, it&rsquo;s hard to craft a PC that stands out. You either end up creating the same fish tank PC as countless others, or an understated black or white-themed build with no RGB.</p>

		<p>x86 has seen setback after setback, and now Arm is looking to capitalize.</p>
<p>x86 has been the primary architecture of PCs and servers over the last few decades, and yet, we&rsquo;re starting to see a tangible shift towards something different. Arm is becoming more and more commonplace, with software vendors finally building their applications for Arm platforms on Windows with the release of the Snapdragon X Elite. Plus, Apple&rsquo;s own shift towards Arm means that an entire segment of mainstream and professional machines are no longer using x86, too.</p>

		<p>Access important notes from any device</p>
<p>I take notes on my smartphone, laptop, and tablet all the time. Whether it&rsquo;s new ideas for articles or a bug that I experience on a device I&rsquo;m testing, I make it a point to note them down since I tend to forget things quite easily. Apart from storing all my notes in one place for quick referencing, I need to be able to access my notes from all of my devices. Since a lot of users have similar requirements, app stores on all platforms are flooded with note-taking apps that cater to this exact use case. So, deciding which tool to use for taking notes and syncing them across your devices can be confusing.</p>
