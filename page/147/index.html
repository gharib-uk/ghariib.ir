		<p>Job Posting: <strong>Multiple Assistant Professor Positions</strong><br>
<em>University of Warsaw</em></p>
<p>The Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw (MIM UW) invites applications for the positions of Assistant Professor in Computer Science, starting on 1st October 2025 or 1st February 2026.</p>
<p>MIM UW is one of the leading Computer Science faculties in Europe. It is known for talented students (e.g., two wins and multiple top tens in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest) and strong research teams, especially in algorithms, logic and automata, algorithmic economy, and computational biology. There is also a growing number of successful smaller groups in diverse areas including cryptography, databases and knowledge representation, distributed systems, and machine learning. Seven ERC grants in Computer Science are running at MIM UW at the moment.</p>

<p>Do they teach networking history classes yet? Or is it still too soon?</p>
<p>I was reading [Al]’s first installment of the Forgotten Internet series, on UUCP. The short summary is that it was a system for sending files across computers that were connected, intermittently, by point-to-point phone lines. Each computer knew the phone numbers of a few others, but none of them had anything like a global routing map, and IP addresses were still in the future. Still, it enabled file transfer and even limited remote access across the globe. And while some files contained computer programs, others files contained more human messages, which makes UUCP also a precursor to e-mail.</p>

<p>Around two years ago, the world was inundated with news about how generative AI or large language models would revolutionize the world. At the time it was easy to get caught up in the hype, but in the intervening months these tools have done little in the way of productive work outside of a few edge cases, and mostly serve to burn tons of cash while turning the Internet into even more of a desolate wasteland than it was before. They do this largely by regurgitating human creations like text, audio, and video into inferior simulacrums and, if you still want to exist on the Internet, there’s basically nothing you can do to prevent this sort of plagiarism. Except feed the AI models garbage data like this YouTuber has started doing.</p>

<p>Just when you think you’ve learned all the latest 3D printing tricks, [TenTech] shows up with an update to their Fuzzyficator post-processing script. This time, the GPL v3 licensed program has gained early support for “paint-on” textures.</p>
<p>Fuzzyficator works as a plugin to OrcaSlicer, Bambu Studio, and PrusaSlicer. The process starts with an image that acts as a displacement map. Displacement map pixel colors represent how much each point on the print surface will be moved from its original position. Load the displacement map into Fuzzyficator, and you can paint the pattern on the surface right in the slicer.</p>

		<p>Finally, a storage medium that can give me tinnitus.</p>
<p>While people usually get started on a project to solve a problem or explore a new place, some of them are done because &ldquo;well, why not?&rdquo; For example, someone has devised a way to store and retrieve data from their PC to a cassette tape with the aid of a 56K modem, and while it&rsquo;s a ton easier to just stick the file on a USB drive and call it a day, you can&rsquo;t deny that this method is pretty darn cool.</p>

<p>At the height of the Cold War, those of us on the western side of the wall had plenty of choice over our radio listening, even if we stuck with our country’s monolithic broadcaster. On the other side in the Soviet Union, radio for many came without a choice of source, in the form of wired radio systems built into all apartments. [Railways | Retro Tech | DIY] grew up familiar with these wired radios, and treats us to a fascinating examination of their technology, programming, and ultimate decline.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates the creation of a containerized API management system for querying real-time sports data. The system uses Amazon ECS (Fargate) for container orchestration, Amazon API Gateway for RESTful endpoints, and integrates seamlessly with an external Sports API. The implementation emphasizes best practices in cloud computing, including API management, container orchestration, and secure AWS service integration.</p>
