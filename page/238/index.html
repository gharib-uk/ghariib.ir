		<p>According to a DOJ press release, the FBI was able to delete the Chinese-used PlugX malware from “approximately 4,258 U.S.-based computers and networks.”</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To retrieve information from and send commands to the hacked machines, the malware connects to a command-and-control server that is operated by the hacking group. According to the FBI, at least 45,000 IP addresses in the US had back-and-forths with the command-and-control server since September 2023.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I can&rsquo;t work on that day, I&rsquo;ve decided that I&rsquo;m going to be ill.</p>
<p>RPGs on portable consoles are always a treat; you can grind levels or farm for materials while you&rsquo;re traveling, waiting for something, or just a quick session during bedtime. So, when I heard that my favorite modern RPG had gotten Steam Deck verification before its PC debut, you know I had to report on it. If you, too, share my desire to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on the Steam Deck during a cold winter&rsquo;s day, then I have some news for you.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The recent Salt Typhoon cyberattack, orchestrated by Chinese attackers, finally gave US officials the much needed nudge to start endorsing strong end-to-end encryption, instead of wanting to undermine it! In this hack, the Chinese infiltrated major American telecommunications networks and, worst of all, they are still in the systems and can not be removed. For US officials, it wasn’t just another cyberattack; it was a wake-up call.</p>

		<p>Developers play a critical role in ensuring banks remain competitive and compliant. One framework gaining significant attention is DORA. If you’re thinking of the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics, this is something different. The Digital Operational Resilience Act is a new regulatory framework focused on safeguarding financial institutions against digital disruptions. For developers, understanding DORA regulations is not just a regulatory necessity; it’s an opportunity to drive innovation and enhance the overall stability of their organizations.</p>
