		<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud computing, efficient operations are the backbone of any successful cloud strategy. Whether you&rsquo;re managing a small-scale application or a complex enterprise environment, ensuring observability, maintaining configurations, and streamlining operations are essential. AWS offers a robust suite of tools to help organizations achieve operational excellence, including CloudWatch, Systems Manager, Config, and Service Catalog.</p>
<h2 id="why-cloud-operations-matter">Why Cloud Operations Matter</h2>
<p>Cloud operations involve the processes and tools used to manage, monitor, and optimize cloud-based infrastructure. These operations ensure your systems remain reliable, secure, and cost-effective. Observability, configuration management, and automation play a pivotal role in achieving these goals:</p>

<p>As CES kicks off in Las Vegas, we’re taking our place amongst the companies and thinkers who’re leading breakthroughs in tech. Some of the topics we’ll touch on in Las Vegas this year — the new breed of AI PCs, using AI in the fight against text and email scams, and AI-generated disinformation, and the state of the Scamiverse online today.</p>
<p>First up on Tuesday, Dan Huynh, our VP of Business Development, joins a panel of business leaders for a look at the new experiences that AI PCs can power. From video and photo editing to far-faster computing to increased security, Dan and the panel will share stories about how AI PCs can transform the way we work, play, and create.</p>

<p>In the world of data processing and messaging systems, terms like “queue” and “streaming” often come up. While they may sound similar, they serve distinct purposes and can significantly impact how systems handle data. Let’s break down their differences in a straightforward way.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h2>
<p>Imagine a coffee shop where customers place orders online or in person. Once an order is processed, the customer is notified to pick it up. In this analogy, orders function like messages in a queue, and the barista processes them one at a time, removing each order from the queue once completed. This is essentially how a message queue operates.</p>

		<p>The Microsoft DevLabs publisher was created as a hub for internal teams at Microsoft to channel their passion for Azure DevOps into experimental extensions. These extensions helped address product gaps and fostered innovation, ultimately benefiting Azure DevOps customers via the public marketplace.</p>

</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>Over time, as the original creators of these extensions moved on to other things, many extensions became outdated. This led to several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unresolved Issues and Questions</strong>: Customer feedback and bug reports were left unaddressed.</li>
<li><strong>Outdated Dependencies</strong>: Security and dependency updates were not maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Customer Frustration</strong>: The resulting decline in extension quality negatively impacted the Azure DevOps experience as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>To restore the value of the Microsoft DevLabs publisher, we conducted a review to identify which extensions should be actively maintained and which needed to be deprecated.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re finally here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been months of rumors and speculation, and we weren&rsquo;t even 100% sure if the GeForce RTX 5090 would arrive in CES 2025. However, the wait is over; we&rsquo;re now seeing a ton of 5090 devices being announced to the public during this year&rsquo;s big tech conference. MSI is by no means a slacker, as it has taken some time to break down all of its devices that it plans to release in the coming year, including a few that have the mighty 5090 powering their graphical heart.</p>

		<p>Organizations face critical decisions when selecting cloud service providers (CSPs). A recent paper titled Strategic Decision-Making in Cloud Services: De-Risking Cloud Lock-In offers insights for senior technology leaders, particularly those in the United States Government, as they navigate these complex choices.</p>
<p>The authors challenge common assumptions about cloud vendor selection and provide practical guidance for making informed decisions that balance flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and risk mitigation.</p>
<h2 id="the-cloud-selection-dilemma">The Cloud Selection Dilemma</h2>
<p>The paper begins by highlighting the significance of choosing a CSP, noting that for large enterprises, cloud migrations are multiyear efforts often viewed as irreversible. Organizations typically choose between three common cloud approaches:</p>
