<p>At Signal, we want to make privacy simple. From the beginning, we’ve designed Signal so that your information is in your hands rather than ours. Technologies like <a href="/docs/">Signal Protocol</a> secure your messages so that they are never visible by anyone but you and the intended recipients. Technologies like <a href="/blog/private-contact-discovery/">private contact discovery</a>, <a href="/blog/signal-private-group-system/">private groups</a>, and <a href="/blog/sealed-sender/">sealed sender</a> mean that we don’t have a plaintext record of your contacts, social graph, profile name, location, group memberships, groups titles, group avatars, group attributes, or who is messaging whom. Plaintext databases have never been our style. We don’t want to build a system where you trust us with your data; we want to build a system where you don’t have to.</p>

<p>They get slapped on street signs. We wear them on our clothes to identify ourselves to distant coworkers during awkward holiday parties. Some people create massive galleries on their laptops in overlapping levels stacked so deep that the hinges begin to lose their structural integrity and LCD screens struggle to remain upright. The digital versions are even more popular, and we get asked about them a lot.</p>
