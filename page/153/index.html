		<p>With a new drag-and-drop feature, Microsoft wants to make sharing files hassle-free for Windows 11 users.</p>
<p>When Windows 11 debuted back in 2021, people had mixed feelings about it, because while the design was refreshing, useful features like the drag-and-drop items on the taskbar were missing, leading to outrage. The taskbar drag-and-drop and other missing features were reintroduced to Windows 11 in the 22H2 update. Now, after more than two years, the software giant is once again rolling up its sleeves to take the drag-and-drop to the next level to make sharing effortless.</p>

		<p>Going direct and getting genuine parts for your favorite consoles should be a thing.</p>
<p>Has the fan seized up inside your game console? How about the display or disc drive? Whenever something goes wrong with a specific part of any video game console, it can be a pain to get it rectified. The most common route is to reach out to the manufacturer, which will require you to either send out the device or seek local assistance from a nearby shop. This can prove time-consuming and costly, depending on whether your console is still under warranty. But what about a classic console? Why don&rsquo;t manufacturers stock and sell parts for all console models?</p>
