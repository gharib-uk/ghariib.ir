<p>It’s the month of top seeds, big upsets, and Cinderella runs by the underdogs. With March Madness basketball cranking up, a fair share of online betting will be sure to follow—along with online betting scams. </p>
<p>Since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018, individual states can determine their own laws for sports betting. Soon after, states leaped at the opportunity to legalize it in some form or other. Today, nearly 40 states and the District of Columbia have “live and legal” sports betting, meaning that people can bet on single-game sports through a retail or online sportsbook or a combination of the two in their state. </p>

		<p><em>This is the second part of a two three four-part series, which covers some recent results on “verifiable computation” and possible pitfalls that could occur there. This post won’t make much sense on its own, so I urge you to start with the first part.</em></p>
<p>In the previous post we introduced a handful of concepts, including (1) the notion of “verifiable computation” proof systems (sometimes inaccurately called “ZK” by the Ethereum community), (2) hash functions, and (3) some ideal models that we use for our security proofs, and (4) the idea that these “ideal models” are bogus — and sometimes they can make us confident in schemes that are totally insecure in the real world.</p>

<p>Over the past two posts I’ve given a bit of background on four subjects: (1) interactive proof systems (for general programs/circuits), (2) the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, (3) random oracles. We’ve also talked about (4) recursive proofs, which will be important but are not <em>immediately</em> relevant.</p>

<p>Messed up or mistakenly deleted configuration files under <code>/etc</code> directory, but no backup? Here’s how to restore the files just like they were originally installed.</p>
<p>In Linux, the <code>/etc</code> directory is the location for storing system-wide configuration files. When installing a software package, it may create and/or read software specific config files under <code>/etc</code> directory for user custom configurations.</p>
<p>To prevent overriding user custom configurations, re-install software packages by default will NOT replace the files under <code>/etc</code> directory, even when you deleted the files under that directory. Though, some packages will ask if keep or replace the old configurations during installation.</p>

		<blockquote>
<p><strong>February 14, 2025:</strong> This post was updated with the recommendation to restrict S3 bucket access to an IAM role by using the <code>aws:PrincipalArn</code> condition key instead of the <code>aws:userid</code> condition key.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>April 2, 2021</strong>: In the section “Granting cross-account bucket access to a specific IAM role,” we updated the second policy to fix an error.</p></blockquote>

<hr>
<p>Customers often ask how to limit access to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to only a specific AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. A popular approach has been to use the <code>Principal</code> element to list the users or roles who need access to the bucket. However, the <code>Principal</code> element needs the exact values of the <code>user</code> ARN, <code>role</code> ARN, or <code>assumed-role</code> ARN. It does not support using a wildcard (*) to include all role sessions, nor does it allow you to use policy variables.</p>

		<p>About one in three organizations that leverage cloud service providers (CSPs) use Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to November 2024 research from Synergy Research Group. This means two things. One is that when attackers are looking to get the most out of a single exploit, they will likely craft them to target AWS systems. And two, that AWS data security best practices are a timely topic for a wide range of today&rsquo;s organizations.

	<div>
		<p>Monitoring your systems doesn’t have to be a chore. If you’re running an Ubuntu server and want to keep tabs on performance metrics—like CPU usage, memory, or disk I/O—Prometheus and Grafana are a dream team. Prometheus collects the data, and Grafana turns it into beautiful, easy-to-read dashboards. I’ve set this up a few times myself, and while it might seem daunting at first, it’s pretty straightforward once you break it down. Let’s walk through it together, step by step, and get your monitoring stack running on Ubuntu.</p>

		<p>VLAN trunking is the easiest way to pass VLAN traffic through multiple switches.</p>
<p>As your home network expands, so do the burdens of administering the list of network appliances. Maybe you&rsquo;ve expanded the number of wired devices in your network, and added additional managed network switches to segregate your house into VLANs for easier management and better security. The question then is how to get tagged VLAN traffic to the other endpoint devices in your network.</p>

		<p>Minikube is a tool that helps you run Kubernetes on your own computer. It creates a small virtual machine that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster. This helps developers test and learn Kubernetes without needing a big server. Minikube is easy to install and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This tutorial will help you to to setup K8s cluster on you Windows machine with the help of minikube.</p>
<p>You must have a hypervisor installed on your Windows system like VirtualBox. So lets get started with the VirtualBox installation.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency offers exciting opportunities—but it’s also a favorite playground for scammers.  </p>
<p>With the rapid rise of deepfake technology and deceptive AI-driven schemes, even seasoned investors can fall victim to fraud. According to McAfee’s <em>State of the Scamiverse</em> report, deepfake scams are on the rise, with the average American now encountering 2.6 deepfake videos daily. And younger adults (18-24) see even more – about 3.5 per day. </p>
<p>From fake investment opportunities to phishing attempts, bad actors are more sophisticated than ever.  </p>
