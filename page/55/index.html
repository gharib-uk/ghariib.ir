		<p>In November 2024, Microsoft Incident Response researchers uncovered a novel remote access trojan (RAT) we named StilachiRAT that demonstrates sophisticated techniques to evade detection, persist in the target environment, and exfiltrate sensitive data. Analysis of the StilachiRAT’s <em>WWStartupCtrl64.dll</em> module that contains the RAT capabilities revealed the use of various methods to steal information from the target system, such as credentials stored in the browser, digital wallet information, data stored in the clipboard, as well as system information.</p>

<p>Aqua Nautilus researchers have discovered a new attack campaign targeting interactive computing environments such as <code>Jupyter</code> <code>Notebooks</code>. The attack consists of multiple stages, beginning with the download of a compressed file from a remote server. Once executed, the attacker deploys several malicious tools to exploit the server and establish persistence. This campaign poses a significant risk to cloud-native environments, as it enables unauthorized access and long-term control over compromised systems.</p>

		<p>Critical infrastructure organizations bear an enormous responsibility. The assets, systems, and networks they manage are crucial to the functioning of a healthy society. They provide water, energy, transportation, healthcare, telecommunications, and more—should they fail, they would bring entire countries to their knees. The vast importance of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) makes it a prime target for cybercriminals. Research from early this year even found that global critical infrastructure suffered 13 cyberattacks every second in 2023. And things are only likely to get worse: the&hellip;</p>

		<p>Immediately update secrets that may have leaked due to the compromise of the changed-files GitHub Action via CVE-2025-30066.</p>
<p>Attacks on open-source mostly start with publishing new malicious packages in repositories. But the attack that occurred on March 14 is in a different league — attackers compromised the popular GitHub Action tj-actions/changed-files, which is used in more than 23,000 repositories. The incident was assigned CVE-2025-30066.  All repositories that used the infected changed-files Action are susceptible to this vulnerability. Although the GitHub administration blocked changed-files Action and then rolled it back to a safe version, everyone who used it should conduct an incident response, and the developer community should draw more general lessons from this incident.</p>

</p>
<p>On March 14th, 2025, security researchers discovered a critical software supply chain vulnerability in the widely-used GitHub Action <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code> (CVE-2025-30066). This vulnerability allows remote attackers to expose CI/CD secrets via the action&rsquo;s build logs. The issue affects users who rely on the <code>tj-actions/changed-files</code> action in GitHub workflows to track changed files within a pull request.</p>
<p>Due to the compromised action, sensitive CI/CD secrets are being inadvertently logged in the GitHub Actions build logs. If these logs are publicly accessible, such as in public repositories, unauthorized users could access and retrieve the clear text secrets. However, there is no evidence suggesting that the exposed secrets were transmitted to any external network.</p>

		<p>Organizations seeking to adhere to the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) Protected B High Value Assets (PBHVA) overlay requirements can use the Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) on AWS solution with the CCCS Medium configuration to accelerate their compliance journey. To further support customers, AWS recently collaborated with Coalfire to assess and verify the LZA solution’s ability to support CCCS PBHVA overlay controls.</p>
<p>By implementing the PBHVA control overlay over a CCCS Medium baseline, you can better protect your organization’s most critical assets from potential threats and vulnerabilities, providing continuity of essential government operations and safeguarding sensitive information.</p>

		<p>Back in May 2019, along with my colleagues Heather Mahalik and Adrian Leong, we wrote the paper &ldquo;<strong>Using Apple “Bug Reporting” for forensic purposes</strong>&rdquo; and some scripts to parse data stored in Sysdiagnose logs.</p>
<p>The paper is still available for download and, for the most part, is still accurate. But time goes on, and new iOS versions have come on the market in recent years. I took a first look at a sysdiagnose generated on a freshly wiped iPhone with iOS 16 natively installed.</p>
