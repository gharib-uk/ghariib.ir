	<b><time>12.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re building a custom PC, chances are you don&rsquo;t want cable clutter crowding your chassis.</p>
<p>When purchasing a new PC, you have two options: buy the parts and build your own custom PC, or get a prebuilt PC from a custom PC builder or an OEM. Either way, cable management is going to be an important factor in how good the finished custom PC looks and that can be a challenge. Things like ARGB fans introduce tons of additional cabling to the mix, as do USB hubs and other considerations. Even just handling the front panel connectors alone can be a challenge in some chassis, but with a few handy tips and some pre-planning, cable management can be tackled with a minimum of fuss.</p>

		<p>Raspberry Pi is almost always the right choice</p>
<p>If you need a small, affordable computer for a personal project you’re trying to put together, there’s never been a better time. Single-board computers comprise a $3 billion market that’s only projected to grow for the next decade. That means there are a lot of options to choose from, but unless you have a very specific need in mind, there’s one name you should consider before any others: Raspberry Pi. Yes, there are dozens of SBC makers out there, but there are tons of reasons why Raspberry Pi still stands above them all.</p>

One moment, they&rsquo;re powering retro consoles; the next, they&rsquo;re attached to drones. If you want more proof that a Raspberry Pi can power just about anything DIY, this awesome jukebox uses the SBC as its beating heart to keep the old traditions alive.</p>
