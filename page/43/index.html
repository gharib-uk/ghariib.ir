	<div>
		<p>In the previous article, Linux on Arm (aarch64) servers&hellip;, we examined flat networks. That is, we used only bare network interfaces and nothing else. That&rsquo;s a good start, but it is often not the topology used, especially with solutions like OpenStack. So in this installment, let’s evaluate how impactful VXLAN encapsulation can be for throughput and CPU consumption.</p>
<p>We’ll reuse the hosts and testing procedures, with only the modifications to add VXLAN. For details on the test environment, please refer to the previously mentioned article.</p>

<p>Imagine walking into a Monday morning only to find your company’s server grinding to a halt. CPU and memory usage are maxed out, services are timing out, and your team is panicking. This was my reality when I discovered a crypto miner malware (<em>perfectl</em>) had hijacked our server. What followed was a battle against resource-hogging processes, undeletable files, and a crash course in Linux file attributes. Here’s how I fought back—and what I learned along the way.</p>

		<p>WhatsApp revealed on Friday that a “zero-click” spyware attack, attributed to the Israeli firm Paragon, has targeted scores of users worldwide, including journalists and members of civil society.</p>
<p>The spyware targeted nearly 100 WhatsApp users, including journalists, and did not require any user interaction, nor did it require clicking links or opening attachments, making it particularly insidious.</p>
<p>In a statement, WhatsApp spokesperson confirmed with Cyber Security News that it had dismantled the attack vector, alerted affected users, and taken steps to notify the public about the breach.</p>

	<b><time>03.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>A new phishing campaign targeting Microsoft advertisers has been uncovered, leveraging malicious Google Ads to steal credentials.</p>
<p>This attack follows a similar campaign targeting Google Ads accounts, illustrating the ongoing threat of malvertising in the digital advertising ecosystem.</p>
<p>The attackers used Google’s sponsored search results to impersonate Microsoft Ads (formerly Bing Ads). These fraudulent ads appeared when users searched for “Microsoft Ads” on Google, redirecting them to phishing sites that mimicked legitimate Microsoft login pages.</p>

		<p>Better late than never.</p>
<p>Phone Link is a handy way to sync your Windows PC and your phone together, but sometimes Microsoft makes decisions that are just plain weird. For instance, if you wanted to unlink a phone, you had to remove it from your Microsoft account and couldn&rsquo;t do it via Windows. Fortunately, Microsoft is finally rectifying this with a new feature that&rsquo;s currently being tested.</p>

		<p>February 1 marks National Change Your Password Day, a timely initiative to combat escalating cyber risks by promoting stronger password practices.</p>
<p>With hacking incidents surging globally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) emphasizes the critical role of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in safeguarding digital accounts.</p>
<p>Despite annual reminders to update passwords, weak or reused credentials remain rampant. Research shows that AI can crack 45% of passwords in under a minute, while common choices like “123456” persist.</p>

		<p>The recent release of Windows 11 version 24H2 has introduced a range of new features and updates, but it has also raised significant cybersecurity concerns.</p>
<p>A longstanding malware technique known as Process Hollowing or RunPE has encountered compatibility issues on this latest Windows update, leading to broader discussions about the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Process Hollowing is a sophisticated code injection technique often used by malware to evade detection. It involves creating a legitimate process in a suspended state, hollowing out its memory, and replacing it with malicious code.</p>
