<p>DevOps practices have transformed the way organizations develop, test, and deliver software. By bringing together development and operations teams, DevOps enables automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). As companies strive for greater efficiency, faster delivery times, and higher-quality software, DevOps has found applications across a variety of industries.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore several real-world <strong>DevOps use cases</strong>, showcasing how organizations are leveraging DevOps to solve specific challenges. Each use case demonstrates the core features and benefits of DevOps in different business contexts.</p>

<p>DeepSeek’s R1 model launch marks a significant milestone in AI accessibility, combining advanced reasoning capabilities with free, unlimited access. The platform’s explosive growth is evident—its mobile app topped the iOS App Store charts within 48 hours of release, indicating unprecedented user adoption rates. While DeepSeek’s open-source model represents a breakthrough in cost-effective AI deployment, the DeepSeek consumer-facing app introduces substantial privacy and security challenges for enterprises. Most critically, the platform’s data collection practices extend far beyond typical usage data: according to DeepSeek’s privacy policy, all user interactions—including prompts, uploaded files, chat histories, voice inputs, images, and even keystroke patterns—are transmitted […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>In a move to enhance user privacy, WhatsApp has rolled out a significant update allowing users to control who can view their profile photos. This feature, available on both iOS and Android devices, provides users with more granular control over their privacy settings.</p>
<p>Previously, WhatsApp users could choose from three options for profile photo visibility: “Everyone,” “My Contacts,” and “Nobody.” The latest update introduces a fourth option, “My Contacts Except,” enabling users to hide their profile pictures from specific individuals without blocking them.</p>

<p>San Jose, Calif. – Jan. 28, 2025</p>
<p>The concept of the Artificial Intelligence Security Operations Center, also known as the AI SOC, is getting a lot of buzz lately. With it comes the potential to deliver better cybersecurity outcomes for organizations of all sizes. Historically, the SOC has been the domain of the large enterprise. Traditional SOCs were built for larger, well-funded organizations with the resources to benefit from a real-time SecOps command center that can monitor, alert, and act upon suspicious or outright malicious activity across the network. Mid-sized organizations with lean security teams and smaller budgets were priced out. </p>

<p>Quadcopters are flying machines. Traditionally, that would mean you’d optimize the design for lightweight and minimum drag, and you’d do everything in a neat and tidy fashion. The thing is, brushless motors and lithium batteries are so power-dense that you really needn’t try so hard. A great example of that is this barebones quadcopter build from [hebel23] all the way back in 2015.</p>
<p>The build is based around the STM32F4 Discovery Board, which [hebel23] scored as a giveaway at Electronica in Munich way back when. It’s plopped on top of a bit of prototyping board so it can be hooked up to the four controllers driving the motors at each corner. The frame of the quadcopter similarly uses cheap material, in the form of alloy profiles left over from an old screen door. Other equipment onboard includes a GY-273 electronic compass module, a MPU6050 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer to keep the thing on the straight and level, and the Fly Sky R9B RC receiver for controlling the thing.</p>

<p>Was your 3D printer working fine over the summer, and now it’s not? With colder temperatures comes an overall surge in print failure reports — particularly with resin-based printers that might reside in outbuildings, basements, or garages. If you think this applies to you, don’t miss [Jan Mrázek]’s tips on improving cold-weather print results. His tips target the main reasons prints fail, helping to make the process a little more resilient overall. [Jan]’s advice is the product of long experience and experimentation, so don’t miss out.</p>

		<p>SentinelLABS has observed an active phishing campaign targeting high-profile X accounts to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</li>
<li>This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.</li>
<li>SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at <a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com">ThreatTips@sentinelone.com</a>.</p>
