<p>It seems like the widespread use of delivery drones by companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart has been perpetually just out of reach. Of course robotics is a tricky field, and producing a fleet of these machines reliable enough to be cost effective has proven to be quite a challenge. But on an individual level, turning any drone into one that can deliver a package is not only doable but is something [Iloke-Alusala] demonstrates with their latest project.</p>

<p>Password brute force is one of the common most attack on WordPress. Only a few hours after the deployment of a new blog, we can see login attempts to /xmlrpc.php or /wp-login.php endpoints. While not being sophisticated, they remain strong attacks as they put pressure on the limited complexity passwords and potential password reuse from users. In this article, we are going to explain how the public</p>
<p>wordpress.com REST API makes it easier for brute-force attacks on millions of WordPress instances managed by wordpress.com or private instances with the Jetpack plugin installed.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Enhancing Threshold Group Action Signature Schemes: Adaptive Security and Scalability Improvements</strong><br>
<em>Michele Battagliola, Giacomo Borin, Giovanni Di Crescenzo, Alessio Meneghetti, Edoardo Persichetti</em></p>
<p>Designing post-quantum digital signatures is a very active research area at present, with several protocols being developed, based on a variety of mathematical assumptions. Many of these signatures schemes can be used as a basis to define more advanced schemes, such as ring or threshold signatures, where multiple parties are involved in the signing process. Unfortunately, the majority of these protocols only considers a static adversary, that must declare which parties to corrupt at the beginning of the execution. However, a stronger security notion can be achieved, namely security against adaptive adversaries, that can corrupt parties at any times. In this paper we tackle the challenges of designing a post-quantum adap- tively secure threshold signature scheme: starting from the GRASS sig- nature scheme, which is only static secure, we show that it is possible to turn it into an adaptive secure threshold signature that we call GRASS+. In particular, we introduce two variants of the classical GAIP problem and discuss their security. We prove that our protocol is adaptively secure in the Random Oracle Model, if the adversary corrupts only t 2 parties. We are also able to prove that GRASS+ achieves full adaptive security, with a corruption threshold of t, in the Black Box Group Action Model with Random Oracle. Finally, we improve the performance of the scheme by exploiting a better secret sharing, inspired from the work of Desmedt, Di Crescenzo, and Burmester from ASIACRYPT’94.</p>

<p>Last year, we published a blog post about the injection of ESI tags in pages to fool the web cache proxy, and in August 2018, our colleague Louis Dion-Marcil spoke at Defcon about the discovery of the ESI Injection uncovered by the GoSecure intrusion testing team. For those interested, the presentation has been released on the Defcon YouTube channel. Defcon and Black Hat gave us an opportunity to unveil how ESI implementations can lead to session leakage through the client web browser without any malicious JavaScript. ESI is a specification that defines statements in the form of XML tags that are interpreted by the caching server. Those statements describe the content assembly of web pages by composing various HTML fragments from external resources. An attacker can abuse this mechanism by injecting a malicious tag inside an intercepted web page.<br>
The current post&rsquo;s objective is to follow up with items discovered after the first publication. Those discoveries are attack vectors that apply to specific implementations. It will also be an excellent platform to describe the proper mitigation for each of those findings.<br>
Three new ESI tricks will be presented:</p>

<p>Cyber criminals continue to refine their phishing tactics, targeting trusted global brands to deceive users and steal sensitive information. Check Point Research (CPR), the intelligence arm of Check Point® Software, has unveiled its latest findings for Q4 2024, revealing key trends in brand phishing attacks. Technology Sector Leads in Phishing Attempts Microsoft retained its dominance as the most imitated brand in phishing schemes, accounting for a staggering 32% of all attempts. Apple followed with 12%, while Google ranked third. Notably, LinkedIn reentered the list at fourth place, emphasizing the persistent targeting of technology and Social Network brands.

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Fast, private and regulated payments in asynchronous networks</strong><br>
<em>Maxence Brugeres, Victor Languille, Petr Kuznetsov, Hamza Zarfaoui</em></p>
<p>We propose a decentralized asset-transfer system that enjoys full privacy: no party can learn the details of a transaction, except for its issuer and its recipient. Furthermore, the recipient is only aware of the amount of the transaction. Our system does not rely on consensus or synchrony assumptions, and therefore, it is responsive, since it runs at the actual network speed. Under the hood, every transaction creates a consumable coin equipped with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (NIZK) that confirms that the issuer has sufficient funds without revealing any information about her identity, the recipient&rsquo;s identity, or the payment amount. Moreover, we equip our system with a regulatory enforcement mechanism that can be used to regulate transfer limits or restrict specific addresses from sending or receiving funds, while preserving the system&rsquo;s privacy guarantees. Finally, we report on Paxpay, our implementation of Fully Private Asset Transfer (FPAT) that uses the Gnark library for the NIZKs. In our benchmark, Paxpay exhibits better performance than earlier proposals that either ensure only partial privacy, require some kind of network synchrony or do not implement regulation features. Our system thus reconciles privacy, responsiveness, regulation enforcement and performance.</p>

<p>The Alabama Community College System in partnership with Advantage Consulting &amp; Solutions is set to debut its inaugural class of the Alabama Cybersecurity Fellowship. Funded by Innovate Alabama, the program aims to address the growing cybersecurity talent gap in Alabama. According to Cybersecurity Ventures data cited by Forbes, there are nearly 750,000 job vacancies across the U.S.</p>

<h2 id="joining-the-owasp-foundation">Joining the OWASP foundation</h2>
<p>The main motivation for joining the OWASP foundation is to make it clear that the project is a community effort. While GoSecure is using the tool internally for code review assessments, it does not plan to commercialize this specific product. Under the OWASP umbrella, it should be clear to the future contributors that the project is not owned by a single organization or author.</p>
