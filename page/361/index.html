		<p>What hardware is needed for security information and event management (SIEM) systems?</p>
<p>At some point, the information security department of any large company inevitably begins to consider introducing a SIEM system — or replacing the existing one, and must therefore estimate the budget required for its deployment. But SIEM isn’t a lightweight product that can be deployed within existing infrastructure. Almost all solutions in this category require additional hardware, meaning that equipment must be purchased or rented.</p>

		<p><em>This post was originally published on Automation.com.</em></p>
<p>As organizations around the globe rapidly adopt AI, it is becoming clear that this transformation brings both significant opportunities and serious risks. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, 65% of participants said their companies regularly used AI, a dramatic increase in a very short period. This growing reliance on AI is transforming industries, especially in operational technology (OT) sectors like manufacturing and energy, where AI is a critical driver for efficiency and automation. However, it is also becoming a powerful tool for cybercriminals, raising the stakes for OT security.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Infostealer capabilities and how to protect your organization against this threat.</p>
<p>Although malicious programs that hunt for passwords, financial, and other sensitive data have been around for over 20 years, the word “infostealer” was coined only in the early 2010s. Recently, however, this relatively simple type of malware has been popping up in unexpected role — deployed as a springboard for major targeted hacks and cyberattacks. For example, the theft of the data of 500 million Ticketmaster customers and a ransomware attack on the Brazilian Ministry of Health were both traced to infostealers. The main challenge posed by infostealers is that they can’t be defeated solely at the infrastructure level and within a company’s perimeter. The non-work activities and personal devices of employees also need to be considered.</p>
