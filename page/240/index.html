		<p>Naturalist John Muir once said, “The mountains are calling, and I must go…” I could not agree more, John.</p>
<p>There is something about the joy of tackling tough challenges. For me, that call has taken me from Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to Machu Picchu in Peru to Everest Base Camp in Nepal (I thought about Taylor Swift Eras tour tickets but alas was not brave enough). In my personal journeys, there is no greater joy than realizing the payoff from all your hard work by reaching the summit – except perhaps in being able to share your joy with others who are on the journey with you!</p>

		<p>It’s been a while since I wrote an “attack of the week” post, and the fault for this is entirely mine. I’ve been much too busy writing boring posts about Schnorr signatures! But this week’s news brings an exciting story with both technical <em>and</em> political dimensions: new reports claim that Chinese security agencies have developed a technique to trace the sender of AirDrop transmissions.</p>
<p>Typically my “attack of the week” posts are intended to highlight recent research. What’s unusual about this one is that the attack is not really <em>new</em>; it was discovered way back in 2019, when a set of TU Darmstadt researchers — Heinrich, Hollick, Schneider, Stute, and Weinert — reverse-engineered the Apple AirDrop protocol and disclosed several privacy flaws to Apple. (The resulting paper, which appeared in Usenix Security 2021 can be found here.)</p>

<p>When it comes to DIY projects, nothing beats the thrill of crafting something that rivals expensive commercial products. In the microphone build video below, [Electronoobs] found himself inspired by DIY Perks earlier efforts. He took on the challenge of building a $20 high-quality microphone—a budget-friendly alternative to models priced at $500. The result: an engaging and educational journey that has it’s moments of triumph, it’s challenges, and of course, opportunities for improvement.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Black-Box Registered ABE from Lattices</strong><br>
<em>Ziqi Zhu, Kai Zhang, Zhili Chen, Junqing Gong, Haifeng Qian</em></p>
<p>This paper presents the first black-box registered ABE for circuit from lattices. The selective security is based on evasive LWE assumption [EUROCRYPT'22, CRYPTO'22]. The unique prior Reg-ABE scheme from lattices is derived from non-black-box construction based on function-binding hash and witness encryption [CRYPTO'23]. Technically, we first extend the black-box registration-based encryption from standard LWE [CRYPTO'23] so that we can register a public key with a function; this yields a LWE-based Reg-ABE with ciphertexts of size $L cdot mathsf{polylog}(L)$ where $L$ is the number of users. We then make use of the special structure of its ciphertext to reduce its size to $mathsf{polylog}(L)$ via an algebraic obfuscator based on evasive LWE [CRYPTO'24].</p>

		<p>As a rule, book reviews are not a thing I usually do.</p>
<p>So when I received an out-of-the-blue email from Cory Doctorow last week asking if I would review his latest book, Red Team Blues, it took a minute to overcome my initial skepticism. While I’m a fan of Cory’s work, this is a narrow/nerdy blog about cryptography, not a place where we spend much time on literature. Moreover, my only previous attempt to review a popular cryptography novel — a quick sketch of Dan Brown’s abysmal <em>Digital Fortress</em> — did not go very well for anyone.</p>
