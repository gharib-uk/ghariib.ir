		<p>We all make mistakes. That is only natural. However, there are cases in which these mistakes can have unexpected consequences. A Twitter user recently found this out the hard way. The ingredients: a cheap USB-C adapter with a network connection, an internet connection and a sandbox.</p>

	<b><time>17.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Microsoft Threat Intelligence discovered a new macOS vulnerability that could allow attackers to bypass Apple’s System Integrity Protection (SIP) in macOS by loading third party kernel extensions. SIP is a security technology that restricts the performance of operations that may compromise system integrity; thus, a SIP bypass affects the overall security of the operating system. Bypassing SIP could lead to serious consequences, such as increasing the potential for attackers and malware authors to successfully install rootkits, create persistent malware, bypass Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC), and expand the attack surface for additional techniques and exploits.</p>

<p>In recent years, many of our applications have been driven by the high volume of data that we are able to collect and process. Some may refer to us being in the age of data. One of the essential aspects of handling such a large amount of data is <strong>anomaly detection</strong> – processes that enable us to identify outliers, data that is outside the bounds of expectation and demonstrate behavior that is out of the norm. In scientific research, anomaly data points could be a cause of technical issues and may need to be discarded when drawing conclusions, or it could lead to new discoveries.</p>

		<p>There were several new releases focusing on automation in 2024, which is just one sign that automation is now officially mission critical. With IT systems and networks more complex than ever, it’s unreasonable and unreliable to try to manage important settings manually. It’s time to embrace and implement automation in 2025. To help, here are the top 10 articles we published last year on the topic of automation.1. Complexity, AI and more: Why automation is now mission-criticalIn this article, author Cindy Russell references a recent IDC study commissioned by Red Hat, which revealed that “</p>

<p>McAfee Total Protection users can feel even more secure online knowing that AV-Comparatives has named it the best in 2024 for both real-world protection and overall speed.</p>
<p>The two awards – the <strong>2024 Real-World Protection Gold Award</strong> and the <strong>Best Overall Speed Gold Award</strong> – underscore McAfee’s commitment to providing powerful security without compromising PC performance, a critical combination at a time <strong>when 59% of people globally report falling victim to an online scam</strong> or knowing someone who has, <strong>with 87% of these individuals losing money</strong>—an astounding average loss of $1,366 USD.</p>

		<p>The consequences of a wave of credit card skimmers—which is normal around the holidays—are starting to show.</p>
<p>Label maker Avery has filed a data breach notification, saying 61,193 people may have had their credit card details stolen.</p>
<p>On December 9, Avery said it became aware of an attack on its systems. An investigation showed that cybercriminals had inserted malicious software that was used to “scrape” credit card information used on its website. This credit card skimmer was active between July 18, 2024, and December 9, 2024.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Beyond Optimal Fault-Tolerance</strong><br>
<em>Andrew Lewis-Pye, Tim Roughgarden</em></p>
<p>One of the most basic properties of a consensus protocol is its fault-tolerance&ndash;the maximum fraction of faulty participants that the protocol can tolerate without losing fundamental guarantees such as safety and liveness. Because of its importance, the optimal fault-tolerance achievable by any protocol has been characterized in a wide range of settings. For example, for state machine replication (SMR) protocols operating in the partially synchronous setting, it is possible to simultaneously guarantee consistency against $alpha$-bounded adversaries (i.e., adversaries that control less than an $alpha$ fraction of the participants) and liveness against $beta$-bounded adversaries if and only if $alpha + 2beta leq 1$.</p>

<p>The Strandbeest is a walking machine, a creation of the celebrated artist Theo Jansen. They can look intimidating in their complexity, but it’s quite possible to build your own. In fact, if you’ve got a 3D-printer, it can be remarkably straightforward, as [Maker 101] demonstrates.</p>
<p>The build relies on an Arduino Uno as the brains. It’s equipped with an L293D motor driver shield to run two DC gear motors which drive the walking assemblies. Power is courtesy of a 3-cell lithium-polymer battery. The chassis, legs, and joints are all 3D-printed, and rather attractively in complimentary colors, we might add.</p>
