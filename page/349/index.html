<p>We like mechanical calculators like slide rules, but we have to admit that we had not heard of the Ott Derivimeter that [Chris Staecker] shows us in a recent video. As the name implies, the derivimeter finds the derivative of a function. To do that, you have to plot the function on a piece of paper that the meter can measure.</p>
<p>If you forgot calculus or skipped it altogether, the derivative is the rate of change. If you plot, say, your car’s speed vs time, the parts where you accelerate or decelerate will have a larger derivative (either positive or negative, in the decelerate case). If you hold a steady speed, the derivative will be zero.</p>

		<p>Every day in the ever-changing technology landscape, we see boundaries shift as new ideas challenge the old status quo. This constant shift is observed in the increasingly sophisticated and connected tools, products, and services people and organizations use on a daily basis, but also in the security that needs to be built into these technologies to protect them against adversaries intent on abusing the same technologies for nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>At Microsoft, we are committed to harnessing the immense potential of AI to help solve many of our technology concerns today. We believe that working on the “bleeding edge” offers one of the best ways to serve our customers and the broader ecosystem, and AI is key to advancing our understanding and technical capabilities in many complex areas of cybersecurity.</p>

		<p>Microsoft is updating SymCrypt, its core cryptographic library, with new quantum-secure algorithms. Microsoft’s details are here. From a news article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first new algorithm Microsoft added to SymCrypt is called ML-KEM. Previously known as CRYSTALS-Kyber, ML-KEM is one of three post-quantum standards formalized last month by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The KEM in the new name is short for key encapsulation. KEMs can be used by two parties to negotiate a shared secret over a public channel. Shared secrets generated by a KEM can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic operations, which aren’t vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm when the keys are of a sufficient size&hellip;</p>

		<p>Strategic use of data is vital for progress in science, commerce, and even politics, but at the same time, citizens are demanding more responsible, respectful use of personal data. Internet users have never felt more helpless about how their data are being used: Surveys show that the vast majority of U.S. adults feel that they have little to no control over the data that the government and private companies collect about them. In response to these concerns, new privacy laws are being enacted in Europe, California, Virginia, and elsewhere around the world.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Software architecture plays a pivotal role in the success of any application. Among the most frequently discussed architectural models are monoliths, modular monoliths, and microservices. Choosing the right model depends on factors such as system complexity, scalability requirements, and maintenance considerations. In this article, we gonna view a quick introduction of each concept with some examples.</p>
<h2 id="monolith">Monolith</h2>
<p>The monolith is the most traditional architectural model, where the entire application is built as a single unit. All components (interface, business logic, and database) are integrated and interact directly within the same project.</p>

<p>As we look back on the cybersecurity landscape of 2024, it’s clear that the world of digital threats continues to evolve at an alarming pace in parallel with AI. This year has seen ransomware groups adapt and innovate, pushing the boundaries of their malicious capabilities and evasiveness from law enforcement. In our annual “Nastiest Malware” report, now in its sixth year, we’ve observed a steady increase in both the number and sophistication of malware attacks. The ransomware sector, in particular, has witnessed the emergence of “business models,” with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) dominating the scene. Elite ransomware authors have concluded that profit sharing and risk mitigation are key contributors to their consistent success and evasion of authorities.</p>

		<p>The next generation of Intel mobile processors has finally arrived.</p>
<p>Intel launched numerous new Arrow Lake mobile processors at CES 2025 to round out its portfolio of low-power CPUs. With the 200V series already available, the company focused on new Core Ultra 200HX, 200H, and 200U processors at this year&rsquo;s event. Intel is offering some serious performance with some of these SKUs, including the flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX and its impressive 24 cores.</p>

		<p>In the recent codecov.io security incident, an attacker modified a shell script used by a common software development tool for code coverage. This modification did not take place at the original source code repository where it would have been visible to others, but after the code was packaged and placed on the web server from which it was served.</p>
<p>Prompted by this incident, we are now releasing new tools that provide information and detection of similar attacks against other projects. The scope is limited to attacks that modify the released code and do not touch the original source code. The following tools are now available:</p>
