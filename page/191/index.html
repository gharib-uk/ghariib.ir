		<p>In a previous blog post, we introduced the IAM Access Analyzer custom policy check feature, which allows you to validate your policies against custom rules. Now we’re taking a step further and bringing these policy checks directly into your development environment with the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code (VS Code).</p>
<p>In this blog post, we show how you can integrate IAM Access Analyzer custom policy check capability into VS Code, so you can identify overly permissive IAM policies and fine-tune access controls early in the development process. This proactive approach to security and compliance helps to ensure that your IAM policies are validated before they are deployed, reducing the risk of introducing misconfigurations or granting unintended access. It also saves developer time by providing fast feedback to developers when they write a policy that does not meet organizational standards.</p>

		<p>A smishing (SMS phishing) campaign is targeting iMessage users, attempting to socially engineer them into bypassing Apple’s built in phishing protection.</p>
<p>For months, iMessage users have been posting examples online of how phishers are trying to get around this protection. And, now, the campign is gaining traction, according to our friends at BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>It works like this: Under normal circumstances, iMessage will disable all links in messages from unknown senders to protect the user against clicking them by accident. However, if a user replies to a message or adds the sender to their contact list, the links are enabled, allowing the person to click on the link.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>IND-CPA$^{text{C}}$: A New Security Notion for Conditional Decryption in Fully Homomorphic Encryption</strong><br>
<em>Bhuvnesh Chaturvedi, Anirban Chakraborty, Nimish Mishra, Ayantika Chatterjee, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay</em></p>
<p>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows a server to perform computations directly over the encrypted data. In general FHE protocols, the client is tasked with decrypting the computation result using its secret key. However, certain FHE applications benefit from the server knowing this result, especially without the aid of the client. Providing the server with the secret key allows it to decrypt all the data, including the client&rsquo;s private input. Protocols such as Goldwasser et. al. (STOC'13) have shown that it is possible to provide the server with the capability of conditional decryption that allows it to decrypt the result of some pre-defined computation and nothing else. While beneficial to an honest-but-curious server to aid in providing better services, a malicious server may utilize this added advantage to perform active attacks on the overall FHE application to leak secret information. Existing security notions fail to capture this scenario since they assume that only the client has the ability to decrypt FHE ciphertexts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new security notion named IND-CPA$^{text{C}}$, that provides the adversary with access to a conditional decryption oracle. We then show that none of the practical exact FHE schemes are secure under this notion by demonstrating a generic attack that utilizes this restricted decryption capability to recover the underlying errors in the FHE ciphertexts. Given the security guarantee of the underlying (R)LWE hardness problem collapses with the leakage of these error values, we show a full key recovery attack. Finally, we propose a technique to convert any IND-CPA secure FHE scheme into an IND-CPA$^text{C}$ secure FHE scheme. Our technique utilizes Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, where the server is forced to generate a proof of an honest computation of the requested function along with the computation result. During decryption, the proof is verified, and the decryption proceeds only if the verification holds. Both the verification and decryption steps run inside a Garbled Circuit and thus are not observable or controllable by the server.</p>

<p>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence is transforming cybersecurity, offering unprecedented opportunities to defend against increasingly complex and automated threats. AI is no longer a support tool—it’s emerging as a central pillar of modern security strategies. From detecting anomalies and automating threat responses to augmenting security teams, AI is enabling defenders to act faster, scale their operations, and outpace attackers. However, as the technology advances, significant challenges remain, from adversarial AI to the cultural inertia of legacy systems.</p>

<p>Advanced Intuit Password Recovery received a major overhaul, adding support for Intuit QuickBooks 2024. For QuickBooks’ annual update, we are excited to provide the complete solution for safe, instant, unconditional password removal. This enhancement addresses a persistent issue in earlier versions, making user management more reliable and efficient for users, IT professionals, and digital forensic specialists.</p>
<h2 id="the-tool">The Tool</h2>
<p>The tool we’re talking about is Advanced Intuit Password Recovery, a lightweight computer forensic product designed to recover lost or forgotten passwords for Intuit Quicken and QuickBooks files. It supports a wide range of Quicken versions from 2006 through 2022 and QuickBooks versions from 2006 through 2023 (and now also 2024), including many international and localized variants. For breaking Quicken passwords, the software is equipped with advanced hardware acceleration, utilizing last-generation NVIDIA video cards to speed up the password recovery process, while QuickBook passwords are subject to instant removal. It can unlock password-protected Quicken .QDF and QuickBooks .QBW files, making it an essential tool for IT professionals managing financial data.</p>

		<p>Insurance company Allstate and its subsidiary Arity unlawfully collected, used, and sold data about the location and movement of Texans’ cell phones through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.</p>
<p>Attorney General Paxton says the companies didn’t give consumers notice or get their consent, which violates Texas’ new Data Privacy and Security Act.</p>
<p>Arity would pay app developers to incorporate software that tracks consumers’ driving data in their apps. When consumers installed these apps they unwittingly downloaded that software, which allowed Arity to monitor the consumer’s location and movement in real-time.</p>

<p>In the latest update of Elcomsoft Distributed Password Recovery (EDPR), we’ve introduced a revamped load-balancing feature. The new feature aims to enhance resource utilization on local workstations across diverse hardware configurations. This update has drastically reduced the time required to break passwords in certain hardware configurations, thanks to a refined load distribution algorithm. In this article, we’ll share some technical details on how load balancing leverages a mix of GPUs and CPU cores.</p>
