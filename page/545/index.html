As we look at a now mature Kali, we see a versatile, flexible Linux distribution, rich with useful security and <a href="https://www.kali.org/features/">penetration testing related features</a>, running on all sorts of weird and wonderful <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/kali-arm">ARM hardware</a>.

<p>I recently had the opportunity to listen to another amazing podcast from 99% Invisible, a program about “design, architecture and the 99% invisible activity that shapes our world.” It got me thinking about how my world is shaped by the way I engage with computers. The podcast is a story about a computer scientist named Doug Engelbart who was, in essence, a crazy brilliant genius. He thought of ways to change how we interacted with computers and, most famously, was the inventor of the computer mouse. He also invented a specialized companion device to the mouse that worked like the one-hand equivalent of a keyboard.</p>

<p>Late this afternoon I took a break from working to surf. The sun was setting and a cool breeze was picking up as grey clouds billowed behind the mountains along Hanalei Bay. I had spent most of the day wrangling content, markup, and CSS, and the Pacific was calling. There was still plenty of work to be done, but balance is important, and my mind needed to reset. Surfing would be today’s lesson.</p>

<p>In this life nearly every relationship we create and maintain is built upon expectations. You do this, I’ll do that, and together we’ll fail to oppose entropy but stand a chance at plotting and navigating a loose course through it. These expectations extend beyond the individual, past the family, and onto society.</p>

<p>When I agreed to take part in Winter Break of Code, I had no idea what to really expect. While many people questioned my choice to spend my winter vacation writing code, I was excited for the opportunity to spend a week hanging out with an eclectic group of people while doing two of my favorite things: coding and surfing.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day Thirteen</em></p>
<p>My ten-year-old mind was completely blown when I realized that I could eavesdrop on the walkie-talkie conversations of the other kids in my neighborhood. I rode my bike to the library in stunned silence, found a book about codes and puzzles, and raced home to my computer. I reluctantly transformed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> into something other than a conduit for modified games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIBBLES.BAS">NIBBLES.BAS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GORILLA.BAS">GORILLA.BAS</a>, and wrote a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a> implementation that worked in both directions. That ended up being the easy part.</p>

<p>A few days ago, someone suggested that we go scuba diving and I said “yeah sure, that sounds fun”. Once we actually got to the dive site I realized I had no clue what I signed up for. I was scared out of my fucking mind, squirming against the ocean’s currents, and convinced I would have to go back to shore while everyone else had fun since I was too much of a wuss. It took some time and a fair amount of patience from my dive instructor before I even made it underwater. But once I reached the calm depths of the ocean, I went from frantically holding my instructor’s hand to feeling comfortable exploring the reefs on my own. Instead of feeling disoriented by being underwater, it began to feel natural to swim among tropical fish and sea turtles.</p>
