Removing backgrounds from video in Kdenlive, the free, open-source video editor for Linux, macOS and Windows, is about to get a whole lot easier. Developers are adding a “modern background removal tool” that uses machine learning to create object masks so you can ‘cut out’ an object, person, or item in a video clip. Real-time background removal features are common in video conferencing/chat apps like Slack. They allow a user to replace their actual backdrop (like a messy kitchen) with an alternative image or, sometimes, even a video clip. And image editing tools like GIMP and Photoshop have long been […]</p>

A sizeable update to the free, open-source video editor Kdenlive is now available to download. Kdenlive 24.12 arrives stuffed like a seasonal bird with bug fixes, performance tweaks, and usability enhancements. Additionally, the editor’s developers have removed support for Qt5 so that, as of this release, it is entirely Qt6. Subtitling gets a big boost with the arrival of Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) subtitle support. The key benefit of these subtitles (I’ll swerve calling them ASS) is greater customisation, including things like text strokes, drop shadows, margins, and even effects like masking. A new Subtitle Manager makes editing, ordering, and […]</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The rise of cloud storage solutions presents companies with numerous options for securing their data, but choosing the right backup provider can be a daunting task. The implications of this choice can affect not only data security but also business continuity.</p>
<p>Selecting a cloud backup provider involves more than just comparing prices; it requires a comprehensive evaluation of various factors that align with your organization’s unique needs. Key considerations include security measures, integration capabilities, and the terms outlined in service-level agreements. Understanding these elements can help organizations make informed decisions that ultimately safeguard their critical information against unforeseen events.</p>

		<p>In May 2020, NIST published Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers (NIST IR 8259), which describes recommended cybersecurity activities that manufacturers should consider performing before their IoT devices are sold to customers. These foundational cybersecurity activities can help manufacturers lessen the cybersecurity-related efforts needed by customers, which in turn can reduce the prevalence and severity of IoT device compromises and the attacks performed using compromised devices. In the nearly five years since this document was released, it has been published</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers: <code>cgroupfs</code> and <code>systemd</code>. In the past, both the kubelet and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>There are many ways of troubleshooting the pods and nodes in the cluster. However, <code>kubectl debug</code> is one of the easiest, highly used and most prominent ones. It provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator&rsquo;s point of view, debugging the node should be as easy as this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>busybox --profile<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>netadmin
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use. Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific necessities, and unfortunately, some can&rsquo;t be debugged by only using the static profiles.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This blog discusses a new feature in Kubernetes 1.31 to improve the handling of supplementary groups in containers within Pods.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-implicit-group-memberships-defined-in-etcgroup-in-the-container-image">Motivation: Implicit group memberships defined in <code>/etc/group</code> in the container image</h2>
<p>Although this behavior may not be popular with many Kubernetes cluster users/admins, kubernetes, by default, <em>merges</em> group information from the Pod with information defined in <code>/etc/group</code> in the container image.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see an example, below Pod specifies <code>runAsUser=1000</code>, <code>runAsGroup=3000</code> and <code>supplementalGroups=4000</code> in the Pod&rsquo;s security context.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>This post describes <em>Pod failure policy</em>, which graduates to stable in Kubernetes 1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.</p>
<h2 id="about-pod-failure-policy">About Pod failure policy</h2>
<p>When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons. Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable failures and continue running to completion.</p>
<p>To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the <code>backoffLimit</code> field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the <code>backoffLimit</code> field and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In Kubernetes 1.31, by default kubectl now uses the WebSocket protocol instead of SPDY for streaming.</p>
<p>This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs matter.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-apis-in-kubernetes">Streaming APIs in Kubernetes</h2>
<p>In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming protocol provides a persistent connection that&rsquo;s bi-directional, low-latency, and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create a shell in a running container from your local workstation and run commands in the container.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Volume group snapshots were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release. The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to <strong>beta</strong>. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.</p>
