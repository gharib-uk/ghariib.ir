</p>
<p>Securing containerized applications demands a multi-layered strategy that spans the entire lifecycle from development to production, a challenge Aqua has spent nearly a decade mastering. Aqua’s Container Security solution provides full lifecycle protection by identifying vulnerabilities early in the build phase, integrating acceptance gates in the CI/CD pipeline to minimize risks, and offering real-time runtime protection in production environments. With the Aqua Platform, organizations can secure container workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, stop attacks as they happen, and maintain compliance, all without slowing development.</p>

<p>In February, we experienced two incidents that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.</p>
<p><strong>February 25 14:25 UTC (lasting 2 hours and 19 minutes)</strong></p>
<p>On February 25, 2025, between 14:25 UTC and 16:44 UTC, email and web notifications experienced delivery delays. At the peak of the incident, the delay resulted in ~10% of all notifications taking over 10 minutes to be delivered, with the remaining ~90% being delivered within 5-10 minutes. This incident was caused by worker pools running too close to capacity at peak times, resulting in a delay in queue processing.</p>

	<div>
		<p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a broad concept encompassing machines that simulate or duplicate human cognitive tasks, with Machine Learning (ML) serving as its data-driven engine. Both have existed for decades but gained fresh momentum when Generative AI, AI models that can create text, images, audio, code, and video, surged in popularity following the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. In this blog post, we examine the most popular Generative AI services and how they evolved throughout 2024 and early 2025. We also try to answer questions like how much traffic growth these Generative AI websites have experienced from Cloudflare’s perspective, how much of that traffic was malicious, and other insights.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Golf is a sport built on tradition, discipline, and respect for fellow players. Unlike many competitive sports, golf requires players to uphold a strong sense of etiquette, ensuring that every round remains enjoyable for all participants. Following proper etiquette fosters a positive atmosphere while maintaining the integrity of the game.</p>
<p>Understanding golf etiquette extends beyond basic rules and regulations. It involves showing courtesy, taking responsibility for the course, and being mindful of pace and behavior. These unwritten guidelines shape the experience, making it smooth and enjoyable for both beginners and experienced players. When golfers respect each other and the game itself, they contribute to a welcoming and professional environment.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Today we are announcing the introduction of Authd support for Google IAM, allowing all Ubuntu users to use their Google account to authenticate to their desktop and servers.</p>
<p>The Google broker snap for Authd is available for free on Ubuntu Desktop and Server 24.04 and it works with both personal and Workspace Google accounts.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>In November 2024, we announced the general availability of Authd: a new authentication daemon for Ubuntu that allows direct integration with cloud-based identity providers for both Ubuntu Desktop and Server. At launch, we supported Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) and since then we have seen a strong adoption in enterprises that wanted to centralize their identity management controls.</p>
