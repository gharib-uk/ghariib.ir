		<p>The rapid rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company, has not only disrupted the AI industry but also attracted the attention of cybercriminals.</p>
<p>As its AI Assistant app became the most downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in January 2025, surpassing OpenAI’s ChatGPT, malicious actors have exploited its popularity to launch phishing campaigns, investment scams, and malware attacks.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals have created fraudulent websites mimicking DeepSeek’s platform to target cryptocurrency users.</p>

		<p>If you’ve been following tech news in the last few days, you’ve heard of DeepSeek. This large language model (LLM) is threatening to disrupt current AI market leaders and fundamentally change the economics of AI-powered applications.</p>
<p>Released by a 200-person Chinese startup, the model appears as capable as state-of-the-art tools offered by OpenAI and Google with the benefit of being significantly faster and less expensive to run. What’s more, DeepSeek has been released to open source and is lightweight enough to run on commodity hardware – any developer can start tinkering with it without having to access costly GPUs. DeepSeek has been heralded as a “Sputnik moment” for AI and has sent shockwaves through financial markets.</p>

		<p>Next-gen frame generation technologies will unlock next-gen gaming sooner.</p>
<p>Nvidia hasn&rsquo;t been shy to talk gaming at 4K with its RTX 40 and RTX 50 series. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 was the most powerful GPU you could buy and the RTX 5090 has since taken that mantle. These graphics cards are great for enjoying all the latest games at 4K with ultra settings configured, though some titles would prove to be too much of a challenge for high frame rates. That&rsquo;s where Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) comes into play. There are various levels to this technology, but it works wonders for high-fidelity gaming and we could see 8K arrive sooner than we think.</p>

<p>Although DIY PCB making has made great strides since the early days of chemical etching, there’s one fly in the ointment: vias. These connect individual layers of the board with a conductive tube, and are essential for dual-layer PCBs, never mind boards with a larger layer stack. The industry standard way of producing them is rather cumbersome and doesn’t scale well to a hobby or prototyping context. Might there be a better way? This is the question that [Levi Janssen] set out to answer with a new home PCB manufacturing project.</p>

<p>The artificial intelligence arms race has a new disruptor—DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has quickly gained traction for its advanced language models.  </p>
<p>Positioned as a low-cost alternative to industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, DeepSeek has drawn attention for its rapid growth, affordability, and potential to reshape the AI landscape.  </p>
<p>But as the buzz around its capabilities grows, so do concerns about data privacy, cybersecurity, and the implications of feeding personal information into AI tools with uncertain oversight. </p>
