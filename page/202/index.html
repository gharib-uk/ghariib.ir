	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>React 19 brings a game-changing improvement with the <strong><code>use</code></strong> API, making data fetching and asynchronous operations in your components a breeze! 🚀 This new approach lets you write cleaner, more readable code by integrating directly with Suspense, eliminating the need for cumbersome lifecycle methods and extra state management. 😊</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The <strong><em>use</em></strong> API in React 19 simplifies <em>fetching data and working with asynchronous resources directly</em> within a component&rsquo;s render function. This eliminates the need for separate lifecycle methods or complex state management for loading and error states.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Why buy a handheld when you can build one?</p>
<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve covered a lot of SBC-related news for XDA, which makes it pretty hard for me to be truly blown away by a project. Fortunately, that only means that the ones that do amaze me are truly something stunning. Such is the case of this DIY OLED handheld, which uses an SBC to create a device you can feasibly build for yourself at home.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Nothing ever truly dies on the internet and these retro operating systems are live and kicking and ready for you to use.</p>
<p>Retro gaming is having a huge revival right now, with hardware emulating classic consoles so you can use original cartridges, to emulators to create retro PCs, and Atari releasing a modern version of the 7800 from the mid-80s for you to use any old cartridges you still have in the attic. It&rsquo;s a fantastic time to be a classic gaming fan, but what about the operating systems that we used to use?</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The eGPU market has been stagnant for years but I believe it&rsquo;s ready to rumble again.</p>
<p>When first introduced to the market, external graphics cards or eGPUs were hailed as the savior of gaming on the go, able to increase the graphical power of the best laptops by offloading the processing to the eGPU. While this was a fantastic idea in theory, the practical applications and slower connectivity standards of the time conspired to make them lackluster at best, and the market went stagnant. Most of the eGPU enclosures available now were released years ago, and the manufacturers haven&rsquo;t really been in a rush to release updated versions.</p>

	<b><time>20.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>2025 is the year your NAS setup gets smarter</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways your typical home NAS differs from its enterprise counterpart, most of which have to do with how the NAS holds, processes, and distributes data. Unlike home users, businesses face far more advanced and taxing needs — managing multiple users, applications, and environments. To handle all this complexity, it is crucial for businesses to leverage all the tools at their disposal to maximize the potential of their NAS while ensuring quick accessibility, data safety, and readiness for any data crisis.</p>

		<p>If you only use CMD as your CLI, check out why PowerShell is a phenomenal built-in utility on Windows 11.</p>
<p>If you have been a long-time Windows user, you are likely familiar with using the Command Prompt for your command-line interface (CLI) work. However, the utility you should be using is PowerShell. It is a far more powerful command line tool for Windows and beyond.</p>

		<p>Excel tips that will save you hours</p>
<p>While we rely on Excel for everything from simple budgeting to complex data analysis, many of us are still stuck using the same basic functions and tricks we learned years ago. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Over the years, I have discovered a treasure trove of hidden shortcuts, clever tips, and time-saving techniques that have transformed the way I use Excel.</p>

		<p>If you love modding your PC, you should seriously consider investing in a 3D printer</p>
<p>Hey, PC enthusiasts, have you ever considered using 3D printing to customize your PC? It’s not just for modding your gaming rig; it can also help with maintenance and upgrades. 3D printing lets you create custom parts and accessories on the fly, experiment with new case designs, and even customize your whole system to suit your unique needs.</p>

		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A fantastic use case for AI Coding Assistants is upgrading applications to modern and supported versions of programming languages, libraries and frameworks. All too often, engineering effort is spent building new features, whilst existing applications are left untouched, until they become unsupported with all kinds of inherent vulnerabilities.</p>
<p><code>Amazon Q Developer</code> introduced a code transformation agent for Java when launched in preview back in November 2023. This agent has undergone multiple iterations and become more accurate and powerful since then. On 3rd December 2024 at AWS re:Invent, the public preview of new transformation capabilities for .NET, mainframe, and VMware workloads was announced.</p>

<p>When the Game Boy Printer was released back in 1998, being able to produce a hard-copy of your <em>Pokémon</em> diploma or your latest Game Boy Camera snapshot at the touch of a button was was pretty slick indeed. But in our modern paperless society, the GB Printer somehow sticks out as even more archaic than the other add-on’s for Nintendo’s iconic handheld. Even among the folks who are still proudly playing the games that support the Printer, nobody actually wants to print anything out — although that doesn’t mean they don’t want to see the images.</p>
