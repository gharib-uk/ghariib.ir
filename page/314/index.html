		<p>For over 15 years, YARA has been growing and evolving until it became an indispensable tool in every malware researcher&rsquo;s toolbox. Throughout this time YARA has seen numerous updates, with new features added and countless bugs fixed. But today, I&rsquo;m excited to announce the biggest change yet: a full rewrite.</p>
<p>YARA-X is a completely new implementation of YARA in Rust, and it has the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Better user experience</strong>: The new command-line interface is more modern and colorful, and error reports are now more explicative. More features aimed at improving the user&rsquo;s experience will be incorporated in the future.</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi cases are a great way to ensure your SBC isn&rsquo;t sitting around, exposed to the elements. However, just because they&rsquo;re practical doesn&rsquo;t mean they have to be boring. We&rsquo;ve seen plenty of 3D-printed Raspberry Pi cases in the past, but this one is especially notable as an excellent addition for anyone using their SBC as a retro console.</p>

		<p>AT&amp;T recently faced a significant cybersecurity breach involving its Snowflake account, leading to the company allegedly paying a ransom to prevent further data leakage. According to various reports, the telecommunications giant paid approximately $370,000 to the hacking group ShinyHunters to delete the stolen data. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges and risks large corporations face in protecting sensitive customer information in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<h3 id="details-of-the-breach">Details of the Breach</h3>
<p>The breach was reportedly carried out by ShinyHunters, a notorious hacking group known for its previous cyber-attacks on various companies. The hackers gained access to AT&amp;T’s Snowflake account, a cloud-based data warehousing service, and managed to exfiltrate sensitive customer data, including call logs and personal information. Following the breach, the hackers demanded a ransom for the deletion of the stolen data.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-10957<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 7 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The UpdraftPlus: WP Backup &amp; Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.24.11 via deserialization of untrusted input in the &lsquo;recursive_unserialized_replace&rsquo; function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>
