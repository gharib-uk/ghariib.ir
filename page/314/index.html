		<p>How to use BitLocker to encrypt your external drives</p>
<p>Windows 11, Windows 10, and even older versions come pre-installed with a security and encryption feature called BitLocker. It enables users to encrypt everything on the drive where Windows is installed, protecting that data from theft or unauthorized access. If you haven’t heard of it, that’s because the feature isn’t available on every Windows PC. It is only available on the Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.</p>

		<p>Please note that this blogpost is part of our #VTMondays series, check out our collection of past publications here.</p>
<p>Many cyberattacks begin by victims visiting compromised websites that host malware or phishing scams, threat actors use domains for different malicious purposes as part of their infrastructure, and malware communicates with external sites for command and control and exfiltration. Detecting suspicious domains and preemptively feeding corporate security systems can disrupt attacks before they happen, with VT Intelligence being the perfect platform to early detect them and monitor malicious campaigns’ evolution.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Craft is now available for Windows and is an excellent productivity tool</p>
<p>For years, Mac users have sung the praises of Craft, a sleek and powerful note-taking app that promises to redefine how we jot down notes, create documents, and publish them on the web. After being exclusive to the Apple platform for years, Craft has finally arrived for Windows. As a long-time Windows user, I couldn’t resist taking it for a spin, especially after the recent version 3.0 update brought some much-awaited features to the table.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re making a change to the IP address for <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">www.virustotal.com</a>. If you&rsquo;re currently whitelisting our IP address in your firewall or proxy, you&rsquo;ll need to update your rules to maintain access to VirusTotal.</p>
<p>Starting November 25th, we&rsquo;ll be gradually transitioning the resolution of <a href="https://www.virustotal.com">www.virustotal.com</a> to a new IP address: <strong>34.54.88.138</strong>. If you have hardcoded the previous IP address (74.125.34.46) in your firewall or proxy, you&rsquo;ll need to update your configuration to include the new IP address. This will ensure continued access to VirusTotal.</p>

		<p>Throughout 2024, Bitdefender Labs has been closely monitoring a series of malvertising campaigns that exploit popular platforms to spread malware. These campaigns use fake advertisements to lure users into installing malicious software disguised as legitimate apps or updates.</p>
<p>One of the more recent campaigns Bitdefender Labs uncovered involves a fake Bitwarden extension advertised on Meta’s social media platform Facebook. The campaign tricks users into installing a harmful browser extension und</p>

<p>Apparently, before a child reaches the age of 13, advertisers will have gathered more 72 <em>million</em> data points on them. I knew I&rsquo;d seen a metric about this sometime recently, so I went looking for &ldquo;7,000&rdquo;, which perfectly illustrates how unaware we are of the extent of data collection on all of us. I started Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) in the first place because I was surprised at where my data had turned up in breaches. 11 years and 14 billion breached records later, I&rsquo;m <em>still</em> surprised!</p>

<p>I’m frequently amused by the sort of stuff my Facebook friends “like”. For example:</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>The more salacious content you find around Facebook often has a hidden agenda, for example the classic She did WHAT in school scam I wrote about last year. Snapchat allows you to take a pic or a video and set an expiry date after which it’s “theoretically” destroyed, just the sort of stuff that appeals to sexting teens. By extension, “leaked” Snapchats are just the sort of stuff that appeal to a whole different audience.</p>
