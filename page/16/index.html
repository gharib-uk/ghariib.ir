<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries like healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, and even autonomous vehicles—making our daily lives hyperconnected. But as more devices come online, relying solely on cloud computing can lead to slow response times, high bandwidth costs and security risks. The traditional cloud-based infrastructure struggles to keep up with the demands of real-time data processing, low latency, and proactive, preventative security. Before we dive in, let me explain what is edge computing is about and how it applies to IoT. Simply put, edge computing processes data right where it’s generated instead of routing it to remote […]</p>

A ‘fresh new look’ is heading to Bodhi Linux, the Ubuntu-based Linux distribution built around the Moksha desktop, a fork of Enlightenment 17. Noting that the look of recent releases has leaned towards the dark side—no, not that one, Darth—the team has decide to give the next release a lighter visual revamp by making a new theme, called Zenithal, default. “Zenithal, developed by Štefan Uram and based on the Ice theme by Simotek, introduces a polished light aesthetic that brings a fresh energy to Moksha.

<p>In a digital landscape hungry for the next big thing in Artificial Intelligence, a new contender called DeepSeek recently burst onto the scene and has quickly gained traction for its advanced language models.</p>
<p>Positioned as a low-cost alternative to industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, DeepSeek has drawn attention for its rapid growth, affordability, and potential to reshape the AI landscape.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a recent investigation by McAfee Labs found that the same hype is now fueling a barrage of malware attacks disguised as DeepSeek software and updates.</p>

<p>Upon loading the screen, we are presented with a file upload and a button to make a jpeg icon. We also note that the version string indicates it was made in 2016, with a version of <code>Version 2016.3717</code>. After playing around with it for a little while, I thought about how there was that ImageMagick bug last year that let you execute code remotely. I wasn’t sure it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>
