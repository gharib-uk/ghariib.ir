		<p>At Tuta we are building a privacy-first alternative to big tech offerings so that everyone can protect their data online by sending encrypted emails and sharing encrypted events with Tuta Mail and Tuta Calendar. This brings our service to the forefront of all kinds of adversaries. As a consequence, Tuta is regularly being attacked with DDoS attacks. While most of the times, we can fend off these attacks without you noticing, the adversaries changed their attack vectors beginning of December which led to several downtimes during the first week of December. We have now immensely improved our DDoS-protection methods and our systems are capable of fending off these attacks. Now, we would like explain what happened and how we mitigated the attacks.</p>

		<p>It’s becoming an organized crime tactic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Card draining is when criminals remove gift cards from a store display, open them in a separate location, and either record the card numbers and PINs or replace them with a new barcode. The crooks then repair the packaging, return to a store and place the cards back on a rack. When a customer unwittingly selects and loads money onto a tampered card, the criminal is able to access the card online and steal the balance.</p>

		<p>A sneaky little tactic.</p>
<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Microsoft has been passing Google some seriously big compliments lately. A few months ago, Microsoft was copying Google&rsquo;s homework by adopting a lot of Chrome&rsquo;s features into Edge in hopes of getting people to change browsers. Now, if you use Bing to search for Google, it&rsquo;ll do its best Google impression and hope you won&rsquo;t notice.</p>
