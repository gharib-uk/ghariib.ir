		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-10957<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 4, 2025, 2:15 p.m. | 6 hours, 7 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The UpdraftPlus: WP Backup &amp; Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.24.11 via deserialization of untrusted input in the &lsquo;recursive_unserialized_replace&rsquo; function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code. An administrator must perform a search and replace action to trigger the exploit.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>

		<p>Get the thock you always wanted with these simple mods.</p>
<p>I absolutely love my mechanical keyboard. For the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been using a Keychron K2 V2 with minor upgrades every now and then. Trust me when I say this &ndash; once you switch to a mechanical keyboard &ndash; there&rsquo;s no going back. There are a plethora of mechanical keyboards out there in the market that you can buy, or you could even build your own mechanical keyboard with custom parts. Regardless of which option you choose, the world of mechanical keyboards is a rabbit hole that keeps going deeper and deeper. What I mean to say is, that you can keep upgrading or modding your keyboard with time to make it even better.</p>
