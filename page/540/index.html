		<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Establishing persistence on a system allows a threat actor continued access or process execution across system restarts or other changes. For this reason, monitoring for and investigating persistence indicators are key components of any robust cybersecurity platform.</p>
<p>Two common persistence techniques are using AutoStart Execution of programs during system boot or logon (T1547) and abusing scheduled task functions (T1053). However, legitimate application activity also frequently involves AutoStart Execution and scheduled task functions, so defending against these techniques requires not only detection monitoring but also analysis by a cybersecurity professional. </p>

<p>It all started with a behemoth of a Next.js application. <strong>15,000 files, 107,000 lines of code, and a staggering 18,000 unit tests.</strong> This was the beast we inherited at Leboncoin.fr, and its CI pipeline was, to put it mildly, a bit of a nightmare.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-a-50-minute-wait-and-growing">The Problem: A 50-Minute Wait (and Growing!)</h2>
<p>Our initial encounter with the CI process was less than ideal. Average build times were hovering around <strong>50 minutes</strong>, with some builds dragging on for <strong>2 hours</strong>.</p>

		<p>Academic digital credentials — the cryptographically verifiable assertion that an individual holds a degree, certificate, or other credential — have been available for the better part of a decade. Yet despite the potential value of these data-rich, transportable credentials to graduates, employers, and academic institutions, digital credentials have by no means become the standard in presenting or verifying skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>A new report from the Digital Credentials Consortium (DCC), housed at MIT Open Learning, explores this gap between the promise of digital credentials and their widespread adoption.</p>

<p>Ransomware’s transformation from a targeted cybercrime to a significant threat to national security has increasingly drawn attention at international forums like the Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) Summit. The 2023 Summit, which brought together representatives from 50 countries, signifies a growing, yet cautious, acknowledgment of the need for collaborative strategies in tackling this complex issue.</p>

		<p>Think back to when your brand new laptop or desktop ran the smoothest, operating at peak performance. Is it still that fast, or does even the simplest task seem to take forever? Before you ditch your current PC, there’s a way to get it running like new again.</p>
<p>First things first, though—you have to understand why your PC is running slowly.</p>
<h2 id="do-computers-slow-down-with-age">Do computers slow down with age?</h2>
<p>If you’ve had your PC for a while, you might think it’s running slower because of aging hardware. But not even brand-new computers run at their optimal speed due to preinstalled bloatware.</p>
