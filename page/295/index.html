<p>Midori web browser announced new 11.5 release recently with some exciting new features.</p>
<p>Midori was a popular lightweight web browser that was default in elementary OS and Bodhi Linux. It’s now a free open-source Firefox derived browser developed by Astian Foundation, and licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL).</p>
<p>The browser released new 11.5 recently, changed its app icon from a green lizard to <strong>new flat design logo</strong> that IMO feels better.</p>

		<p>A great controller with excellent compatibility</p>
<p>This 8BitDo Pro 2 is one of our favorite controllers. Not only does it feel good in the hand, but it also manages to deliver great performance as well. But where it really shines is with its retro look and its versatility, with support for PC, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. While this controller usually has a retail price of $50, it can now be had for much less.</p>

		<p>Application Security teams face a constant uphill battle in risk reduction due to the ever-growing number of vulnerabilities. This year alone, 36,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) have been reported — a 25% increase from last year. The sharp rise intensifies the challenge of prioritization in vulnerability management, especially for lean AppSec teams.</p>
<p>To help, we’ve introduced several new enhancements to our Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solution. These improvements are available for all GitLab Ultimate customers:</p>

		<p>Samsung unveiled some ultra powerful gaming monitors at CES 2025</p>
<p>The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is where some of the largest names in tech gather to announce the technologies and products that will define next year&rsquo;s product cycles. Against that backdrop, CES is also well-known for outrageous product releases not exactly aimed at the average consumer, and Samsung&rsquo;s new Odyssey gaming monitors announced at CES 2025 are the perfect example.</p>

The problem of disparate, complex systems – each coming from disparate, complex places – all being thrown together in an enterprise has been one the industry has been mulling over for some time. Any change to an individual service could have repercussions across the whole suite, and interconnected issues like these continue to perplex and overwhelm practitioners.
