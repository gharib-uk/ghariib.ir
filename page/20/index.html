		<p>AI is transforming businesses — from automated agents performing background workflows, to improved search, to easier access and summarization of knowledge. </p>
<p>While we are still early in what is likely going to be a substantial shift in how the world operates, two things are clear: the Internet, and how we interact with it, will change, and the boundaries of security and data privacy have never been more difficult to trace, making security an important topic in this shift.</p>

		<p>Rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and the availability of accessible developer tools have made it relatively easy to incorporate sophisticated AI capabilities into applications. In the past two years, we’ve seen countless AI-powered applications launched. At the same time, developers have been discovering how to enhance existing software with conversational interfaces, predictive analytics, automated customer support, and similar features.</p>
<p>The AI boom caught many by surprise, and standards and regulations have taken a while to catch up. But things are now changing. While the establishment of a regulatory landscape looms, industry standards, spearheaded by the EU AI Act, are moving forward to lead the way.</p>

		<p>North Korean threat actors attempt to further missile program by compromising sanctioned Russian defense company with OpenCarrot backdoor.</p>
<p>The post Comrades in Arms? | North Korea Compromises Sanctioned Russian Missile Engineering Company appeared first on SentinelOne DE.</p>
<p><strong>By Tom Hegel and Aleksandar Milenkoski</strong> </p>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>SentinelLabs identified an intrusion into the Russian defense industrial base, specifically a missile engineering organization NPO Mashinostroyeniya.</li>
<li>Our findings identify two instances of North Korea related compromise of sensitive internal IT infrastructure within this same Russian DIB organization, including a specific email server, alongside use of a Windows backdoor dubbed OpenCarrot.</li>
<li>Our analysis attributes the email server compromise to the ScarCruft threat actor. We also identify the separate use of a Lazarus Group backdoor for compromise of their internal network.</li>
<li>At this time, we cannot determine the potential nature of the relationship between the two threat actors. We acknowledge a potential sharing relationship between the two DPRK-affiliated threat actors as well as the possibility that tasking deemed this target important enough to assign to multiple independent threat actors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>North Korean threat actors have caught our attention over the past year, providing us with fruitful insight into a variety of campaigns, such as new reconnaissance tools, (multiple) new supply chain intrusions, elusive multi-platform targeting, and new sly social engineering tactics. To add to that list, let’s take a look at an intrusion into what might be considered a highly desirable strategic espionage mission – supporting North Korea’s contentious missile program.</p>

<p><strong>February 26, 2025</strong>: We’ve updated this post to fix a typo in the code in <strong>Step 5 – Deploy your workload</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Many customers want to seamlessly integrate their on-premises Kubernetes workloads with AWS services, implement hybrid workloads, or migrate to AWS. Previously, a common approach involved creating long-term access keys, which posed security risks and is no longer recommended. While solutions such as Kubernetes secrets vault and third-party options exist, they fail to address the underlying issue effectively.</p>

		<p>Red Hat recently released the Insights proxy which helps you connect your environment to Red Hat&rsquo;s Insights services. This is covered in the blog Streamline the connectivity between your environment and Red Hat Insights services.To help showcase this new capability and how it works, we released a video that shows you how to set up the Insights proxy and how to configure your hosts to use the proxy. Direct link to the video: Insights ProxyDocumentation for Insights proxy can be found at redhat.com/insightsdocs in the documentation titled Connecting to Red Hat Insights through Insights proxy.S</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Quantum computers are actively being developed that will eventually have the ability to break the cryptography we rely on for securing modern communications. Recent breakthroughs in quantum computing have underscored the vulnerability of conventional cryptography to these attacks. Since 2017, Cloudflare has been at the forefront of developing, standardizing, and implementing post-quantum cryptography to withstand attacks by quantum computers. </p>
<p>Our mission is simple: we want every Cloudflare customer to have a clear path to quantum safety. Cloudflare recognizes the urgency, so we’re committed to managing the complex process of upgrading cryptographic algorithms, so that you don’t have to worry about it. We&rsquo;re not just talking about doing it. Over 35% of the non-bot HTTPS traffic that touches Cloudflare today is post-quantum secure. </p>

		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution in the context of the logged on user. Depending on the privileges associated with the user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
