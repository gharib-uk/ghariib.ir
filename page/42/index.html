		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Cycles and Cuts in Supersingular L-Isogeny Graphs</strong><br>
<em>Sarah Arpin, Ross Bowden, James Clements, Wissam Ghantous, Jason T. LeGrow, Krystal Maughan</em></p>
<p>Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny graphs underlie isogeny-based cryptography. For isogenies of a single prime degree $ell$, their structure has been investigated graph-theoretically. We generalise the notion of $ell$-isogeny graphs to $L$-isogeny graphs (studied in the prime field case by Delfs and Galbraith), where $L$ is a set of small primes dictating the allowed isogeny degrees in the graph. We analyse the graph-theoretic structure of $L$-isogeny graphs. Our approaches may be put into two categories: cycles and graph cuts.</p>

		<p>A new threat to cybersecurity has emerged in the form of Devil-Traff, a bulk SMS platform designed to facilitate large-scale phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>Leveraging advanced features such as sender ID spoofing, API integration, and support for malicious content, this platform has become a favorite tool for cybercriminals worldwide.</p>
<p>Phishing attacks often begin with a seemingly legitimate text message. For example:-</p>
<p><em><strong>“Suspicious activity detected on your account. Click here to secure your account.”</strong></em></p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Efficient Quantum-safe Distributed PRF and Applications: Playing DiSE in a Quantum World</strong><br>
<em>Sayani Sinha, Sikhar Patranabis, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay</em></p>
<p>We propose the first $textit{distributed}$ version of a simple, efficient, and provably quantum-safe pseudorandom function (PRF). The distributed PRF (DPRF) supports arbitrary threshold access structures based on the hardness of the well-studied Learning with Rounding (LWR) problem. Our construction (abbreviated as $mathsf{PQDPRF}$) practically outperforms not only existing constructions of DPRF based on lattice-based assumptions, but also outperforms (in terms of evaluation time) existing constructions of: (i) classically secure DPRFs based on discrete-log hard groups, and (ii) quantum-safe DPRFs based on any generic quantum-safe PRF (e.g. AES). The efficiency of $mathsf{PQDPRF}$ stems from the extreme simplicity of its construction, consisting of a simple inner product computation over $mathbb{Z}_q$, followed by a rounding to a smaller modulus $p &lt; q$. The key technical novelty of our proposal lies in our proof technique, where we prove the correctness and post-quantum security of $mathsf{PQDPRF}$ (against semi-honest corruptions of any less than threshold number of parties) for a polynomial $q/p$ (equivalently, &ldquo;modulus to modulus&rdquo;)-ratio.</p>

<em>Sarah Arpin, Jun Bo Lau, Ray Perlner, Angela Robinson, Jean-Pierre Tillich, Valentin Vasseur</em></p>
<p>Quasi-cyclic moderate-density parity check (QC-MDPC) code-based encryption schemes under iterative decoders offer highly-competitive performance in the quantum-resistant space of cryptography, but the decoding-failure rate (DFR) of these algorithms are not well-understood. The DFR decreases extremely rapidly as the ratio of code-length to error-bits increases, then decreases much more slowly in regimes known as the waterfall and error-floor, respectively.</p>

		<p>As a data security global black belt, I help organizations secure AI solutions. They are concerned about data oversharing, data leaks, compliance, and other potential risks. Microsoft Purview is Microsoft’s solution for securing and governing data in generative AI.</p>
<p>I’m often asked how long it takes to deploy Microsoft Purview. The answer depends on the specifics of the organization and what they want to achieve. Microsoft Purview should enable a comprehensive data governance program but it can provide risk mitigation for generative AI in the short term while the program is underway.</p>

<p>You’ve probably noticed that everywhere you go — the doctor’s office, hotels, or retail shops, there are tiny PCs everywhere. These small PCs often show up on the surplus market for a very good price, but they aren’t quite full-blown PCs. They usually have little option for expansion and are made to be cheap and small. That means many of them have custom and anemic power supplies. We aren’t sure if [bm_00] needed a regular power supply to handle a graphics card or if the original power supply died, but either way, the HP small-form-factor box needed a new power supply. It took some clever work to be able to use a normal power supply in the little box.</p>

		<p>Turn your old USB flash drive into a secure unlock key for additional PC security.</p>
<p>Keeping your PC secure these days can be tricky. If you rely solely on a PIN or password, your system is more vulnerable to unwanted access. With Windows Hello integration, which introduces biometric data, things have improved. But if your PC doesn’t offer it, or you want something tangible, you might want another solution. However, you might not want to buy a dedicated security key like a YubiKey or a Thetis FIDO U2F. However, have you considered turning that old USB drive in your drawer into a secure unlock key instead?</p>

<p>In his most recent article, [Ken Shirriff] takes a break from putting ASICs under a microscope, and instead does the same in a proverbial manner with the word ‘mainframe’. Although these days the word ‘mainframe’ brings to mind a lumbering behemoth of a system that probably handles things like finances and other business things, but originally the ‘main frame’ was just one of many ‘frames’. Which brings us to the early computer systems.</p>

Do you use the official Spotify DEB on Ubuntu (or an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution like Linux Mint)? If so, you’ll be used to receiving updates to the Spotify Linux client direct from the official Spotify APT repo, right alongside all your other DEB-based software. Thing is: if you haven’t checked for updates from the command line recently you might not be aware the that security key used to ‘sign’ packages from the Spotify APT repo stopped working at the end of last year. Annoying, but not catastrophic as it—thankfully—doesn’t stop the Spotify Linux app from working just pollutes terminal output […]</p>
