A new year has started, and who knows what kind of innovations and improvements it holds for for Ubuntu, which remains the world’s most used desktop Linux operating system. We get 2 new releases of Ubuntu each year, one in April and one in October. Plus, new point releases of the latest long-term support release rolling up bug fixes, app updates, and back-porting newer Linux kernels and GPU drivers. So 2025 should be another golden year for Ubuntu, those of us using it, and the Linux and open-source community as a whole. Changes to Ubuntu in 2024 span a wide […]</p>

		<p>If you’re a Linux user, and you use distros such as Ubuntu or Debian, then you will have surely seen the command apt update. But what is it, exactly, and why do you want to run it often? In this article, we are going to break down the apt update command into simple words and explain what role it has in keeping your system running as it should.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-apt">What is apt?</h2>
<p><strong>APT</strong> is an acronym for <strong>Advanced Package Tool</strong>, and it is a command-line utility that allows us to handle software packages in Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu. An example of a package manager that you can use is called <code>apt</code> and is used to install, upgrade, and remove packages on your system.</p>

<p>In a 2020 paper, Patrick Lewis and his research team introduced the term RAG, or retrieval-augmented generation. This technique enhances generative AI models by utilizing external knowledge sources such as documents and extensive databases. RAG addresses a gap in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). While traditional models rely on static knowledge already contained within them, RAG incorporates current information that serves as a reliable source of truth for LLMs. Although LLMs can rapidly understand and respond to prompts, without RAG, they often fall short in providing current or more specific information.</p>

		<p>In the wake of EU drafted legislation and US executive orders, a software bill of materials (SBOM) has gone from a nice-to-have to a fundamental piece of software documentation. In this article, we’ll examine what an SBOM is, what information it must include, and the approaches that developers and manufacturers alike should consider as they start building their SBOM.</p>
