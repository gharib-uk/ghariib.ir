	<div>
		<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare, precision medicine stands as a beacon of hope, promising tailored treatments that cater to our unique genetic makeup. Yet, despite its potential, many individuals find themselves grappling with the complexities surrounding polygenic risk scores (PRS) — powerful tools designed to predict disease susceptibility based on multiple genetic factors. Are you one of those who feel overwhelmed by medical jargon or unsure about how these scores could impact your health journey? You’re not alone; countless patients and practitioners alike face significant barriers in understanding and implementing PRS effectively. This blog post aims to demystify polygenic risk scores while addressing common challenges such as accessibility, education gaps, and ethical considerations that hinder their widespread use. Through insightful case studies showcasing successful applications of PRS and a forward-looking perspective on future advancements in this field, we will explore how you can harness these insights for better health outcomes. Join us as we unlock the door to precision medicine together—your pathway to informed decisions awaits!</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2025-0366<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Feb. 1, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 days, 1 hour ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.7 via the get_svg() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution. In this specific case, an attacker can create a form that allows SVG uploads, upload an SVG file with malicious content and then include the SVG file in a post to achieve remote code execution. This means it is relatively easy to gain remote code execution as a contributor-level user and above by default.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>

GNOME has announced a change to its default UI and monospace fonts ahead of the upcoming GNOME 48 release — a typographic turnabout that won’t impact Ubuntu users directly, though. Should you feel a sense of deja vu here it’s because GNOME trialled a font switch last year, during development of GNOME 47. Back then, it replaced its home-grown Cantarell font with the popular open-source sans Inter font (trivia: used by Zorin OS). The change was reverted prior to the GNOME 47 due to various UI quirks, coverage issues, and compatibility (thus underlying the importance of testing things out prior […]</p>

		<p>Budget GPUs seemingly have a champion in the Arc B580, if only it didn&rsquo;t tank with budget CPUs.</p>
<p>When Intel&rsquo;s Arc B580 unveiled the company&rsquo;s new Battlemage architecture over a month ago, it was met with glowing reviews, universally hailed as an affordable 1440p ray tracing GPU. For only $250 (if you could get it at that price), it was comfortable beating the likes of RTX 4060 in almost all titles. Soon after, however, reports started coming in that the Arc B580 had a serious performance overhead issue in the very segment it was targeting.</p>

One of the software industry&rsquo;s most important pain points in testing is “<strong>Coverage</strong>”. It is manually impossible to generate test cases while covering edge cases and different scenarios with the scale of how much code gets written each day. AI Agents here save time and improve test coverage and reliability. Developers can now focus on core logic while AI handles repetitive and error-prone tasks like writing unit tests.</p>

		<p>A <strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong> is a security solution designed to protect web applications by monitoring, filtering, and blocking malicious HTTP/S traffic.</p>
<p>Operating at the OSI model’s application layer (Layer 7), a WAF acts as a reverse proxy between users and web applications, analyzing incoming requests and outgoing responses to identify and mitigate potential threats.</p>
<p>It is particularly effective against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>

		<p>If 2024 taught us anything, it’s that a proactive, no-compromises approach to security is essential for 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>Nation-states and advanced cybercriminals are making significant investments in infrastructure and automation to intensify familiar cyberattack patterns; password attacks, for example, escalated from 579 incidents per second in 20211 to 7,000 in 2024.2 These groups are also adopting emerging technologies such as AI to create deepfakes and personalized spear-phishing campaigns that manipulate people into granting unauthorized access.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Don&rsquo;t be quick to splurge on the RTX 5090</p>
<p>Nvidia&rsquo;s GeForce RTX 5090 is the most powerful consumer graphics card you can buy in 2025. One of the main reasons it costs $2,000 is that it has no competition from AMD and Intel. However, even if you can afford to spend that much money on this flagship graphics card, you have to be very careful because there are some important factors to consider before you put it inside your case. Otherwise, you may have to spend even more on additional components to enjoy all the performance gains it brings to the table.</p>

	<div>
		<p>As organizations increasingly adopt Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and manage their cloud environments, ensuring the security of these configurations has become a critical priority.</p>
<p>IaC allows teams to define infrastructure using code, enabling rapid deployment and scalability, but it also introduces risks such as misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can expose systems to attacks.</p>
<p>To mitigate these risks, specialized tools have emerged to scan IaC templates for vulnerabilities, enforce compliance with security standards, and ensure robust cloud infrastructure.</p>
