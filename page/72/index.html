		<p>A deep dive on the work that went into making the component that powers repository and pull request file trees.</p>
<p>The post Considerations for making a tree view component accessible appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>Tree views are a core part of the GitHub experience. You’ve encountered one if you’ve ever navigated through a repository’s file structure or reviewed a pull request.</p>

		<p>In the past decade, Oracle Database (Oracle DB) has reigned supreme in the competitive arena of database engine popularity ranking as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This pervasiveness has led Oracle Database to be trusted by Fortune 500 companies (e.g. Netflix, LinkedIn, eBay, etc.) to house, process, and safeguard their critical data. Its popularity can be attributed to its ability to handle massive volumes of data and concurrent transactions with high performance, making Oracle Database optimized for enterprise-level workloads, where speed, efficiency, and reliability are critical.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Cryptanalysis of an Efficient Signature Based on Isotropic Quadratic Forms</strong><br>
<em>Henry Bambury, Phong Q. Nguyen</em></p>
<p>We present a key-recovery attack on DEFI, an efficient signature scheme proposed recently by Feussner and Semaev, and based on isotropic quadratic forms, borrowing from both multivariate and lattice cryptography. Our lattice-based attack is partially heuristic, but works on all proposed parameters: experimentally, it recovers the secret key in a few minutes, using less than ten (message,signature) pairs.</p>

<strong>Description :</strong> A flaw was found in ArgoCD. The openshift.io/cluster-monitoring label is applied to all namespaces that deploy an ArgoCD CR instance, allowing the namespace to create a rogue PrometheusRule. This issue can have adverse effects on the platform monitoring stack, as the rule is rolled out cluster-wide when the label is applied.<br>
