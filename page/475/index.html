	<div>
		<p>Aembit, the non-human IAM company, today announced the appointment of Mario Duarte as chief information security officer (CISO). Duarte, formerly head of security at Snowflake, joins Aembit with a deep commitment to address pressing gaps in non-human identity security.</p>
<p>Duarte’s journey in cybersecurity began with a passion for penetration testing, sparked by the 1980s cult classic film WarGames. He started his career in red teaming, later expanding his expertise into both technical and leadership roles on the defensive side. Throughout his career, he has focused on protecting mission-critical systems, solving complex security problems, and developing and overseeing high-performing teams.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>The cloud and DevOps promised to make our infrastructure faster, cheaper and easier. However, in many organizations, this promise, unfortunately, fell short. Engineering teams find themselves trapped in a cycle of duplicating infrastructure, agonizing over the tools and components for each &lsquo;unique&rsquo; use case, grappling with security concerns, and ultimately navigating the complex realm of operations. In some cases, disillusioned organizations are even retracting workloads from the cloud – a scenario exemplified by the well-known case of 37Signals.</p>
