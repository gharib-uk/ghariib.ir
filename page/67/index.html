<p>While we aren’t heavy-duty woodworkers, we occasionally make some sawdust as part of a project, and we admire people who know how to make wood and do what they want. We were surprised when [Newton Makes] showed a wooden dowel that was quite long and was mostly hollow. The wall was thin, the hole was perfectly centered, and he claimed he did not use a drill to produce it. Check it out in the video below and see what you think.</p>

		<p>In the modern era of cloud computing, deploying and managing resources efficiently is critical for organizations aiming to innovate quickly. With its robust suite of services like machine learning (ML) models, cognitive APIs and AI-powered applications, Azure AI has become popular for businesses looking to harness artificial intelligence (AI). However, manual deployment and management of these resources can be time-consuming and error-prone. This is where Red HatAnsible Automation Platform comes into play.This blog explores how you can take advantage of Ansible Automation Platform to automate</p>

		<p>The architecture is designed to simulate a neural network with hierarchical memory management, dynamic adaptation, and performance optimization. The goal of this architecture is to present an alternative to modern neural models, which are often complex and resource-intensive, taking inspiration from our brains, neurons are decentralized organized in layers, allowing them to interact with themselves and change theirselves overtime in more than just sates and weights, while also creating a dynamic memory system.<br>

<p>Today’s security approach is siloed. Each deployed security tool is designed to provide a specific type of protection across different areas like the network, endpoints, email, and cloud environments. This hybrid methodology, often requiring dozens of systems, leads to several security and operational challenges for security operations center (SOC) and network operations center (NOC) teams. Adopting a hybrid environment is unavoidable, and Gartner[1] anticipates that “By 2025, over 50% of network firewall deployments will involve more than two deployment factors from the same vendor — up from less than 10% in 2023.” [1]  While the benefits of this new ecosystem are […]</p>

		<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to overcomplicate our relationship here, I feel like sharing a journey and you&rsquo;re free to join me on that journey-would certainly make me feel less alone on this informal path of life.<br>
My name is Israa, I&rsquo;m currently 26 and I live in Cairo, Egypt. I never thought I would be here right now, I&rsquo;m very grateful for the magical path I&rsquo;m on. One thing I would like to tell you about myself is my river of curiosity which I am merely a passenger on. I like to trust myself enough to know that I&rsquo;m ending somewhere well.<br>
What path am I on, you ask? Well, there&rsquo;s something calling me towards tech in general, perhaps towards development and engineering. I still have no idea but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in figuring it out as you go. So far I learnt the difference between a front-end and back-end development. I&rsquo;ll come back tomorrow with more updates.</p>

<p>Artificial consciousness is the next frontier in AI. While artificial intelligence has advanced tremendously, creating machines that can surpass human capabilities in certain areas, true artificial consciousness represents a paradigm shift—moving beyond computation into subjective experience, self-awareness, and sentience.</p>
<p>In this video, we explore the profound implications of artificial consciousness, the defining characteristics that set it apart from traditional AI, and the groundbreaking work being done by McGinty AI in this field. McGinty AI is pioneering new frameworks, such as the McGinty Equation (MEQ) and Cognispheric Space (C-space), to measure and understand consciousness levels in artificial and biological entities. These advancements provide a foundation for building truly conscious AI systems.</p>
