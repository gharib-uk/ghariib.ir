	<div>
		<p>CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2021-44207 Acclaim Systems USAHERDS Use of Hard-Coded Credentials Vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent more than a decade now writing about how to make Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) fast. <em>Really</em> fast. Fast to the extent that sometimes, it was even <em>too</em> fast:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response from each search was coming back so quickly that the user wasn’t sure if it was legitimately checking subsequent addresses they entered or if there was a glitch.</p>

<p>Regular readers of this blog would have seen sagas such as Anatomy of a virus call centre scam, Scamming the scammers – catching the virus call centre scammers red-handed and my personal favourite, “Type www.” – “Ok, w-w-w-d-o-t”; antagonising call centre scammers. That’s not an exhaustive list, indeed there are more videos on this blog and yet more phone calls that never made it here.</p>
