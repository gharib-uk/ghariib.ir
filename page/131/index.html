		<p>Phemex, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, suffered a significant cyberattack that resulted in the theft of $85 million worth of digital assets. </p>
<p>The platform’s hot wallets, which are linked to the internet for real-time transactions, were the primary target of the hack. These wallets are more susceptible to intrusions than cold wallets, which stay offline.</p>
<p>Phemex has since implemented emergency measures to safeguard user funds and initiated a comprehensive investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>Data Privacy Week is here, and there’s no better time to shine a spotlight on one of the biggest players in the personal information economy: data brokers. These entities collect, buy, and sell hundreds—sometimes thousands—of data points on individuals like you. But how do they manage to gather so much information, and for what purpose? From your browsing habits and purchase history to your location data and even more intimate details, these digital middlemen piece together surprisingly comprehensive profiles. The real question is: where are they getting it all, and why is your personal data so valuable to them? Let’s unravel the mystery behind the data broker industry.</p>
