		<p>Empowering development teams with self-service and automation capabilities has long been a goal for organizations seeking to reduce bottlenecks and speed up innovation. However, many traditional approaches to self-service fall short, bogged down by ticket queues and overwhelmed operations teams. Additionally, a lack of ownership in maintaining component catalogs, lack of product mindset and constant changes to curated technologies are some of the key reasons that platform engineering initiatives fail in many organizations.For development teams tasked to develop and maintain software solutions,</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Polynomial Inversion Algorithms in Constant Time for Post-Quantum Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Abhraneel Dutta, Emrah Karagoz, Edoardo Persichetti, Pakize Sanal</em></p>
<p>The computation of the inverse of a polynomial over a quotient ring or a finite field plays a very important role during the key generation of post-quantum cryptosystems like NTRU, BIKE, and LEDACrypt. It is therefore important that there exist an efficient algorithm capable of running in constant time, to prevent timing side-channel attacks. In this article, we study both constant-time algorithms based on Fermat&rsquo;s Little Theorem and the Extended $GCD$ Algorithm, and provide a detailed comparison in terms of performance. According to our conclusion, we see that the constant-time Extended $GCD$-based Bernstein-Yang&rsquo;s algorithm shows a better performance with 1.76x-3.76x on texttt{x86} platforms compared to FLT-based methods. Although we report numbers from a software implementation, we additionally provide a short glimpse of some recent results when these two algorithms are implemented on various hardware platforms. Finally, we also explore other exponentiation algorithms that work similarly to the Itoh-Tsuji inversion method. These algorithms perform fewer polynomial multiplications and show a better performance with 1.56x-1.96x on texttt{x86} platform compared to Itoh-Tsuji inversion method.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 5, 2025</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that global cybercrime damages will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. This staggering figure highlights the urgent need for enhanced defenses against ransomware, phishing attacks, and emerging threats like deepfake-based fraud.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are revolutionizing cybersecurity. On the one hand, AI-powered tools enable faster threat detection, real-time incident response, and predictive analytics. Tools like machine learning-driven intrusion detection systems can identify anomalies with unprecedented accuracy, helping organizations mitigate risks before they escalate.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Today, we are thrilled to announce the integration of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) provenance standard into Cloudflare Images. Content creators and publishers can seamlessly preserve the entire provenance chain — from how an image was created and by whom, to every subsequent edit — across the Cloudflare network.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-c2pa-and-the-content-authenticity-initiative">What is the C2PA and the Content Authenticity Initiative?</h3>
<p>When you hear the word provenance, you might have flashbacks to your high school Art History class. In that context, it means that the artwork you see at the Met in New York really came from the artist in question and isn’t a fake. Its provenance is how that piece of physical art changed possession over time, from the original artist all the way to the museum. </p>

		<p>When was the last time you enjoyed a software update? If you’re struggling to remember, you’re not alone. While engineers can now deploy code changes in seconds, making those changes useful and enjoyable is not easy.</p>
<p>Progressive Delivery, a term coined by James Governor in 2018, offers a fresh framework for addressing these challenges. With the upcoming release of Progressive Delivery: How To Build the Right Thing for the Right People at the Right Time by James Governor, Kimberly Harrison, Heidi Waterhouse, and Adam Zimman, let’s explore this transformative approach to software delivery.</p>

<p>Love it or hate it, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and other AI tools are reshaping the modern workplace. As AI becomes a critical part of daily work, establishing guardrails and deploying monitoring tools for these tools is critical. That’s where Check Point’s Harmony SASE comes in. We’ve already talked about Browser Security and the clipboard control feature to help define what types of information can’t be shared with LLMs. For monitoring these services, our GenAI Security service shows exactly which AI tools your team is using, who is using them, what kind of information they’re sharing with the […]</p>

		<p>We are excited to announce the release of a new capability in Bitbucket Pipelines that will improve your experience diagnosing issues with your pipeline runs, by allowing you to view and access previous runs within the Pipelines UI.</p>

<p>The previous pipeline <strong>Runs</strong> dropdown will not show up if you re-run an entire pipeline, because re-running an entire pipeline creates an entirely separate pipeline record, rather than an additional run on an existing pipeline.</p>
