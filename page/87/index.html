<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 4, 2025</p>
<p>Cybercrime is among the most significant threats to modern businesses—no matter the size of the company or its sector. With Cybersecurity Ventures predicting that the damage costs will be $10.5 trillion globally in 2025—enough to make it the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China—cybercrime has become an unavoidable business risk that affects every organization with digital assets.</p>

		<p>Educational technology, or EdTech, is revolutionizing the way we learn and teach. By integrating advanced tools and digital platforms into educational systems, EdTech is creating more personalized, efficient, and accessible learning experiences for students worldwide. From K-12 schools to universities and corporate training programs, the impact of technology in education is profound and growing.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Learning Experiences</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant advancements in EdTech is the ability to offer personalized learning experiences. Adaptive learning platforms use artificial intelligence to analyze a student’s strengths, weaknesses, and learning pace. These systems then tailor content and assessments to meet individual needs, ensuring that each student can progress at their own speed. This approach is particularly effective in bridging learning gaps and supporting students with diverse abilities.</p>

<p>There’s good news in the US federal compliance space. The latest FedRAMP policy on the use of cryptographic modules relaxes some of the past restrictions that prevented organizations from applying critical security updates.</p>
<p>There has long been a tension between the requirements for strictly certified FIPS crypto modules and the need to keep software patched and up to date with the latest security vulnerability fixes. The new guidance goes a ways to resolving this tension – and best of all, it aligns perfectly with how we’ve already been approaching FIPS module updates for Ubuntu.</p>

<p>A PCB ruler is a common promotional item, or design exercise. Usually they have some sample outlines and holes as an aid to PCB design, but sometimes they also incorporate some circuitry. [Clovis Fritzen] has given us an ingenious example, in the form of a PCB ruler with a built-in thermometer.</p>
<p>This maybe doesn’t have the fancy seven segment or OLED display you were expecting though, instead it’s an ATtiny85 with a lithium cell, the minimum of components, a thermistor for measurement, and a couple of LEDs that serve as the display. These parts are interesting, because they convey the numbers by flashing. One LED is for the tens and the other the units, so count the flashes and you have it.</p>
