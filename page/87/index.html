	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>We are happy to announce that Ubuntu on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is now available in Microsoft’s new tar-based distribution architecture. </p>
<p>Ubuntu has been a widely used Linux distribution on WSL, offering a familiar development environment for many users. This new distribution architecture for WSL will make adoption easier in enterprise environments by enabling image customization and deployments at scale. The new tar-based WSL distro format allows developers and system administrators to distribute, install, and manage Ubuntu WSL instances from tar files without relying on the Microsoft Store.</p>

	<div>
		<p>There is a constant “cat and mouse” game between defenders and attackers, the latter trying to outsmart and get a head start on the former. In the context of online advertising, this involves creating fake identities or using stolen ones to push out malicious ads.</p>
<p>An attacker not only needs to evade detection but also create a lure that will be convincing to most people. In this blog post, we focus on what malvertisers use in almost all of their campaigns, namely decoys also known as “white pages” in order to fool the advertising entity.</p>

	<div>
		<p>The rapid evolution of 5G networks is driving business transformation within many industries, enabling high-speed connectivity, ultra-low latency and support for the massive internet of things (mIoT).5G is not just an evolution from 4G. 5G demands network transformation for both the radio access network (RAN) and the core network to unlock its full potential. To achieve this transformation, telecommunication service providers are adopting new and distributed architectures that use software-defined, disaggregated infrastructure and automation for the delivery and management of diverse services.</p>

		<p>Making your own bad news is not what Valley News Live had in mind, but negligence comes at a price.</p>
<p>Cybernews researchers found an unprotected AWS S3 bucket that belongs to Take Valley News Live, a North Dakota-based television station. Gray Television, the owner of Valley News Live, makes for the third largest broadcasting company in the US.</p>
<p>An S3 bucket is like a virtual file folder in the cloud where you can store various types of data, such as text files, images, videos, and more. There is no limit to the amount of data you can store in an S3 bucket, and individual instances can be up to 5 TB in size.</p>
