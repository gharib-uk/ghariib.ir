<p>You know that “Hi, how are you?” text from a stranger? It’s one of the top scams worldwide—right along with those fake delivery notices that try to reel you in a scam site with a fishy link. Now you have extra protection against them and all other kinds of scams with our new McAfee Scam Detector.</p>
<p>The time’s right for it too. Those scam stats above came from our latest research, which also uncovered just how often people get hit with scams and how costly they can be. 59% of Americans said they or someone they know has fallen for an online scam in the last 12 months, with scam victims losing an average of $1,471 to the scam.</p>

<p>In the quest for an accurate frequency standard there are many options depending on your budget, but one of the most affordable is an oven controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO). [RF Burns] has a video looking at one of the cheapest of these, a sub ten dollar AliExpress module.</p>
<p>A crystal oven is a simple enough device — essentially just a small box containing a crystal oscillator and a thermostatic heater. By keeping the crystal at a constant temperature it has the aim of removing thermal drift from its output frequency, meaning that once it is calibrated it can be used as a reasonably good frequency standard. The one in question is a 10 MHz part on a small PCB with power supply regulator and frequency trimming voltage potentiometer, and aside from seeing it mounted in an old PSU case we also are treated to an evaluation of its adjustment and calibration.</p>

<p>As <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> continues to chip away at the environment, next year, data centres will face a pivotal moment. Facilities will start to realise that there isn’t enough energy. Companies that were influenced by competitive urgency and rushed into AI, now face decisions regarding cost and sustainability of the technology. For example, some AI in-house setups cost upwards of $300,000 in hardware alone.  </p>

<h2 id="what-is-kubernetes-cost-optimization">What Is Kubernetes Cost Optimization? </h2>
<p>Kubernetes cost optimization involves reducing expenses associated with running applications in Kubernetes environments without compromising performance or availability. It requires a strategic approach to managing <strong>resources such as compute, storage, and networking</strong>. By optimizing these elements, organizations can ensure they only pay for what they actually use and need, avoiding unnecessary expenses.  </p>
<p>Cost optimization techniques in Kubernetes include rightsizing pods, selecting appropriate instance types for workloads, implementing auto-scaling, and setting resource quotas. The goal is to strike a balance between cost savings and maintaining application performance. This requires continuous monitoring and adjustment to adapt to changing demands.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of surprises to be had when you become a parent, and one of the first is that it’s suddenly your job to record  the frequency of your infant’s various bodily functions in exacting detail. How many times did the little tyke eat, how long did they sleep, and perhaps most critically, how many times did they poop. The pediatrician will expect you to know these things, so you better start keeping notes.</p>

Sad news from Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth today: longtime Ubuntu and Debian contributor Steve Langasek has passed away. In a touching post on the Ubuntu Discourse, Mark Shuttleworth shares: “Steve passed away at the dawn of 2025. His time was short but remarkable. He will forever remain an inspiration.” “Judging by the outpouring of feelings this week, he is equally missed and mourned by colleagues and friends across the open source landscape, in particular in Ubuntu and Debian where he was a great mind, mentor and conscience.” As a former Debian and Ubuntu release manager, and a long-term Canonical employee, […]</p>
