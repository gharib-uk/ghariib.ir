<p>The rise of AI-driven cyber threats has introduced a new level of sophistication to phishing scams, particularly those targeting Gmail users.</p>
<p>Criminals are using artificial intelligence to create eerily realistic impersonations of Google support representatives, Forbes recently reported. These scams don’t just rely on misleading emails; they also include convincing phone calls that appear to come from legitimate sources.</p>
<p><strong>If you receive a call claiming to be from Google support, just hang up</strong>—this could be an AI-driven scam designed to trick you into handing over your Gmail credentials.</p>

		<p><em>Trigger warning: incredibly wonky theoretical cryptography post (written by a non-theorist)!</em> <em>Also, this will be in two parts. I plan to be back with some more thoughts on practical stuff, like cloud backup, in the near future.</em></p>
<p>If you’ve read my blog over the years, you should understand that I have basically two obsessions. One is my interest in building “practical” schemes that solve real problems that come up in the real world. The other is a weird fixation on the theoretical models that underpin (the security of) many of those same schemes. In particular, one of my favorite bugaboos is a particular model, or “heuristic”, called the random oracle model (ROM) — essentially a fancy way to think about hash functions.</p>

<p>There are times when you feel like you&rsquo;re drowning in a sea of information and struggling to connect the dots between ideas, projects, and those random sparks of inspiration. I tried various note-taking and productivity apps, but they did not meet my needs for creating a visual knowledge base. I was starting to think that a good old-fashioned notebook and some highlighters were the best way to keep my thoughts organized. Then I discovered Noteey.</p>

		<p>In part 1 of this blog series, we walked through the risks associated with using sensitive data as part of your generative AI application. This overview provided a baseline of the challenges of using sensitive data with a non-deterministic large language model (LLM) and how to mitigate these challenges with Amazon Bedrock Agents. The next question that might come to mind is where and how to use sensitive data across LLM training, fine-tuning, vector databases, agents, and tooling. In this blog post, we build on part 1 with a more detailed discussion about data governance. Then, knowing the data governance baseline, we walk through how to use sensitive data across different data sources with the correct data authorization model. Lastly, we talk about how to implement data authorization mechanisms as part of a generative AI application that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as part of the architecture.</p>

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) user? If so, you will be pleased to hear that Ubuntu is now available in Microsoft’s new tar-based distro format — no need to use the sluggish Microsoft Store. Canonical announced the news today, noting that “the new tar-based WSL distro format allows developers and system administrators to distribute, install, and manage Ubuntu WSL instances from tar files without relying on the Microsoft Store.” In not relying on the Microsoft Store for distribution, it’s less hassle for enterprises to roll out (and customise) Ubuntu on WSL at scale as images packaged in using the new […]</p>

<p>Today we’re announcing ChatGPT Gov, a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed to provide U.S. government agencies with an additional way to access OpenAI’s frontier models.</p>
<p>Agencies can deploy ChatGPT Gov in their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud or Azure Government cloud on top of Microsoft’s Azure’s OpenAI ⁠ (opens in a new window) Service. Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements, such as stringent cybersecurity frameworks (IL5, CJIS, ITAR, FedRAMP High). Additionally, we believe this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Use of ChatGPT Gov is subject to our usage policies, like other OpenAI services.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>We are excited to introduce a new capability in Bitbucket Pipelines – Step Failure Strategies. This is the first of a set of new features allowing developers to implement more comprehensive logic and control-flow inside their CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>Failure Strategies are designed to give you explicit control over how your pipeline behaves in the event that an individual step within the pipeline fails. This initial release will include the <code>ignore</code> strategy, which is particularly useful for complex pipelines with steps like code styling suggestions or informational tests, where certain steps failing within the pipeline shouldn’t necessarily cause the entire build to fail.</p>
