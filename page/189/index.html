		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Non-Interactive Distributed Point Functions</strong><br>
<em>Elette Boyle, Lalita Devadas, Sacha Servan-Schreiber</em></p>
<p>Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) are a useful cryptographic primitive enabling a dealer to distribute short keys to two parties, such that the keys encode additive secret shares of a secret point function. However, in many applications of DPFs, no single dealer entity has full knowledge of the secret point function, necessitating the parties to run an interactive protocol to emulate the setup. Prior works have aimed to minimize complexity metrics of such distributed setup protocols, e.g., round complexity, while remaining black-box in the underlying cryptography.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On Gaussian Sampling for $q$-ary Lattices and Linear Codes with Lee Weight</strong><br>
<em>Maiara F. Bollauf, Maja Lie, Cong Ling</em></p>
<p>We show that discrete Gaussian sampling for a $q$-ary lattice is equivalent to codeword sampling for a linear code over $mathbb{Z}_q$ with the Lee weight. This insight allows us to derive the theta series of a $q$-ary lattice from the Lee weight distribution of the associated code. We design a novel Gaussian sampler for $q$-ary lattices assuming an oracle that computes the symmetrized weight enumerator of the associated code. We apply this sampler to well-known lattices, such as the $E_8$, Barnes-Wall, and Leech lattice, highlighting both its advantages and limitations, which depend on the underlying code properties. For certain root lattices, we show that the sampler is indeed efficient, forgoing the need to assume an oracle. We also discuss applications of our results in digital signature schemes and the Lattice Isomorphism Problem. In many cases, our sampler achieves a significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art sampling algorithms in cryptographic applications.</p>

<p>The OWASP Global AppSec Dublin 2023 conference was a truly inspiring event for anyone involved in application security. As an attendee, I was able to catch up with OWASP colleagues and hear from experts on a range of topics. </p>
<p>In particular, there were two themes that really stood out to me: <em>worldwide</em> and <em>threat modeling</em>.</p>
<h4 id="owasp-the-open-worldwide-application-security-project">OWASP: The Open Worldwide Application Security Project</h4>
<p>During the conference, the OWASP Board made an exciting announcement regarding the meaning of the letter &ldquo;W&rdquo; in OWASP. Traditionally, the &ldquo;W&rdquo; in OWASP has stood for &ldquo;Web,&rdquo; reflecting the organization&rsquo;s initial focus on web application security. The Board announced they are changing the meaning of the &ldquo;W&rdquo; to &ldquo;Worldwide,&rdquo; reflecting the global nature of the OWASP project and its mission.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>poqeth: Efficient, post-quantum signature verification on Ethereum</strong><br>
<em>Ruslan Kysil, István András Seres, Péter Kutas, Nándor Kelecsényi</em></p>
<p>This work explores the application and efficient deployment of (standardized) post-quantum (PQ) digital signature algorithms in the blockchain environment. Specifically, we implement and evaluate four PQ signatures in the Ethereum Virtual Machine: W-OTS$^{+}$, XMSS, SPHINCS+, and MAYO. We focus on optimizing the gas costs of the verification algorithms as that is the signature schemes&rsquo; only algorithm executed on-chain, thus incurring financial costs (transaction fees) for the users. Hence, the verification algorithm is the signature schemes&rsquo; main bottleneck for decentralized applications.</p>

<p>Want to install Kodi home theater software v21.2 “Omega” via native <code>.deb</code> package? Here’s a PPA for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, though unofficial.</p>
<p>Kodi has an official Ubuntu PPA, which has not been updated for long time. The official package for Linux now is Flatpak that runs in sandbox environment.</p>
<p>For those who don’t like Flatpak or have issue running the software in sandbox, here’s an unofficial PPA available for Ubuntu 24.04 and Linux Mint 22 users.</p>
