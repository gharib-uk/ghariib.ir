		<p>It is important to know which NVIDIA driver version is installed on your Linux system for compatibility with your hardware and software. The driver version ensures your graphics card works properly and supports the applications you use. Knowing the version also helps when updating or troubleshooting. You can check the installed version using commands like <code>nvidia-smi</code> or by checking system settings in your Linux distribution.</p>
<p>This tutorial will help you understand how to check the NVIDIA driver version on your Linux system. It will guide you step-by-step using simple commands and tools.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Comments are an important part of any programming languages that help users to understand about working of code block. Similar to other programming languages Python also allows us to add comments in our code. We can use single line comments or multiline comment for block of code. Assuming you have to comment out multiple adjacent lines in a file, then you can use multi-line comments in your Python application.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about comment block of code in Python scripts. We can use triple quotes to comment out a block of code in Python. You can either use triple single-quotes <code>'''</code> or triple double-quotes <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code>.</p>

		<p><em>This ongoing</em> <em>Docker Labs GenAI series</em> <em>explores the exciting space of AI developer tools. At Docker, we believe there is a vast scope to explore, openly and without the hype. We will share our explorations and collaborate with the developer community in real time. Although developers have adopted autocomplete tooling like GitHub Copilot and use chat, there is significant potential for AI tools to assist with more specific tasks and interfaces throughout the entire software lifecycle. Therefore, our exploration will be broad. We will be releasing software as open source so you can play, explore, and hack with us, too.</em></p>

	<div>
		<p>Git push is a regular process used by developers to send changes to a remote repository. Recently, I noticed that I committed a few unnecessary files and pushed them to the remote Git repository. These files were not required and should have been excluded. To fix this, I plan to remove them from the repository and update the <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid pushing such files in the future.</p>
<p>To delete the last pushed commit, you can follow these steps. Make sure you understand the implications of rewriting commit history, especially if working in a shared repository.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Linux provides several powerful tools to monitor system performance, especially memory and CPU usage. Sometimes we need to identify the processes that are consuming high memory and CPU to troubleshoot performance issues. You can use preinstalled system utilities like ps, top commands or external tools like htop, vmstats etc. Each tool comes with different advantages.</p>
<p>This article explains how to identify the top processes consuming memory and CPU using simple commands.</p>

Ubuntu Pro is an optional security feature that Ubuntu LTS users can enable to receive critical updates for an extra 25,000 packages which would otherwise sit unpatched. If you use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS you will have seen Ubuntu Pro security updates in Software Updater (or when running apt commands). And you will have noticed you can’t install those updates without having an Ubuntu Pro subscription. Ubuntu Pro is free for all users on up to 5 machines, meaning the only ‘cost’ involved is the time it takes to register and setup Ubuntu Pro. Businesses (or home users) with fleets of […]</p>

	<div>
		<p>Maintaining secure and efficient network access is crucial for distributed companies. The challenge lies in balancing convenience with security, often leading organizations to seek innovative solutions. Enter Tailscale, a modern VPN solution that provides a seamless way to connect distributed teams while enhancing security and simplifying network management.</p>

</p>
<p>Tailscale operates on a concept known as a mesh VPN, where devices communicate directly instead of routing traffic through a central server. This structure not only increases speed and reliability but also simplifies network configuration for remote teams. By leveraging Tailscale, businesses can build a private network accessible from anywhere in the world, effectively streamlining their digital workspace.</p>
