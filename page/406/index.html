		<p>Andover, MA based <strong>Casa Systems</strong> [<strong>1.</strong>] today announced a strategic technology and distribution partnership with <strong>Google Cloud</strong> to further advance and differentiate Casa Systems and Google Cloud’s integrated cloud native software and service offerings. The partnership  provides for formalized and coordinated global sales, marketing, and support engagement, whereby Casa Systems and Google Cloud will offer Communication Service Providers (CSPs) and major enterprises integrated Google Cloud-Casa Systems solutions for cloud-native 5G core, 5G SA multi-access edge computing (MEC), and enterprise mobile private network use cases.  It’s yet another partnership between a telecom company and a cloud service provider (e.g. AWS, Azure are the other two) to produce cloud native services and software.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At MWC 2023 Barcelona, <strong>Google Cloud</strong> announced that they can now run the <strong>radio access network (RAN)</strong> functions as software on Google Distributed Cloud Edge, providing communications service providers (CSPs- AKA telcos) with a common and agile operating model that extends from the core of the network to the edge, for a high degree of programmability, flexibility, and low operating expenses.  CSPs have already embraced open architecture, open-source software, disaggregation, automation, cloud, AI and machine learning, and new operational models, to name a few. The journey started in the last decade with Network Functions Virtualization, primarily with value added services and then deeper with core network applications, and in the past few years, that evolved into a push towards cloud-native. With significant progress in the core, the time for <strong>Cloud RAN</strong> is now, according to Google.  However, whether for industry or region-specific compliance reasons, data sovereignty needs, or latency or local data-processing requirements, most of the network functions deployed in a mobile or wireline network may have to follow a hybrid deployment model where network functions are placed flexibly in a combination of both on-premises and cloud regions. RAN, which is traditionally implemented with proprietary hardware, falls into that camp as well.</p>

<p>In 2025, <strong>cloud native security</strong> is set to undergo transformative progress. As Chief Information Security Officer at Aqua, I’ve seen how rapidly evolving threats and operational demands are driving organizations to redefine their approach to security. The focus is no longer just on adapting to challenges—it’s about deeply embedding security into every facet of development pipelines, runtime environments, and cloud ecosystems. </p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>For the last couple of years, a lot of attention has been placed on the evolutionary state of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on cybersecurity. In many industries, the risks associated with AI-generated attacks are still present and concerning, especially with the global average of data breach costs increasing by 10% from last year.</p>
<p>However, according to the most recent Cloud Threat Landscape Report released by IBM’s X-Force team, the near-term threat of an AI-generated attack targeting cloud computing environments is actually moderately low. Still, projections from X-Force reveal that an increase in these sophisticated attack methods could be on the horizon.</p>

		<p>So many times, we look beyond the mark. With our feeds constantly inundated with headline-grabbing news about AI-generated threats, nation states upping their cybercrime game, and sophisticated new forms of malware, we can be tempted to think that the bulk of cyberwarfare is going on &ldquo;up there&rdquo; somewhere. In reality, most breaches still originate from unforced errors, and threat actors are just like anybody else – they don&rsquo;t like working harder than they need to. That&rsquo;s why the golden rule of cybercrime seems to be &ldquo;try the easy stuff first.&rdquo; And some of the easiest things are doors that&hellip;</p>

		<p>The holidays are upon us, which means now is the perfect time for gratitude, warmth, and—because modern society has thrust it upon us—gift buying.</p>
<p>It’s Bluey and dig kits and LEGOs for kids, Fortnite and AirPods and backpacks for tweens, and, for an adult you particularly love, it’s televisions, air fryers, e-readers, vacuums, dog-feeders, and more, which all seemingly require a mobile app to function.</p>
<p>“The Internet of Things” is the now-accepted term to describe countless home products that connect to the internet so that they can be controlled and monitored from a mobile app or from a web browser on your computer. The benefits are obvious for shoppers. Thermostats can be turned off during vacation, home doorbells can be answered while at work, and gaming consoles can download videogames as children sleep on Christmas Eve.</p>
