<strong>Description :</strong> Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to versions 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2, Next.js is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution. This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version. There are no official workarounds.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 5.3 | MEDIUM<br>

<strong>Description :</strong> PhpSpreadsheet is a PHP library for reading and writing spreadsheet files. Versions prior to 3.7.0, 2.3.5, 2.1.6, and 1.29.7 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in custom properties. The HTML page is generated without clearing custom properties.

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-56513<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 3, 2025, 5:15 p.m. | 1 hour, 45 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> Karmada is a Kubernetes management system that allows users to run cloud-native applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds. Prior to version 1.12.0, the PULL mode clusters registered with the `karmadactl register` command have excessive privileges to access control plane resources. By abusing these permissions, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent to a karmada cluster would be able to obtain administrative privileges over the entire federation system including all registered member clusters. Since Karmada v1.12.0, command `karmadactl register` restricts the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources. This way, an attacker able to authenticate as the karmada-agent cannot control other member clusters in Karmada. As a workaround, one may restrict the access permissions of pull mode member clusters to control plane resources according to Karmada Component Permissions Docs.<br>

		<p>Accelerated by the pandemic, online tech communities have grown rapidly. With new members joining every day, it’s tough to keep track of past conversations. Often, newcomers ask questions that have already been answered, causing repetition and redundancy. To tackle this, we built an intelligent assistant that tracks past conversations, searches Stack Overflow for technical help, and browses the web for relevant information.</p>
<p>InSightful is a ReAct (Reasoning and Action) Agent with access to multiple tools, such as a web searcher and a context retriever, to achieve the given task. In our case, it is a question and answer application. We will delve deeper into the workings of the application as we progress. At the end of the day, you will be able to understand how agents work and how you can develop your own. These agents are highly customizable, giving you a lot of flexibility in picking a use-case.</p>
