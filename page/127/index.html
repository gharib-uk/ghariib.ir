		<p>Ready to take your backups to the cloud? Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p>Storing data in the cloud using free or expensive subscriptions is one thing, but it&rsquo;s a whole different beast to store even more data in the long term. You could use Apple iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive for all your backups and data you don&rsquo;t need to frequently access, but when working with big data or cold storage, it&rsquo;s best to use a provider with the means to manage files for longer periods and provide the support and software to make your life easier. We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the best long-term cool and cold storage providers right here.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>See why we think Figma is better than Penpot for UX/UI design.</p>
<p>UX/UI prototyping tools are becoming some of the most important design software in the modern day. With lives lived with computers in our hands, apps, and responsive web design, we need more design intention than what’s been offered in previous years. With Figma, you can easily design and prototype entire websites, apps, or even presentations and small animated videos. With great power and development, it’s no wonder that Figma rules against its open-source alternative of Penpot. Although Penpot is Figma’s best alternative, the real deal is the better option for UX/UI design.</p>
