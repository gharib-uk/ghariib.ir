		<p>In the recent codecov.io security incident, an attacker modified a shell script used by a common software development tool for code coverage. This modification did not take place at the original source code repository where it would have been visible to others, but after the code was packaged and placed on the web server from which it was served.</p>
<p>Prompted by this incident, we are now releasing new tools that provide information and detection of similar attacks against other projects. The scope is limited to attacks that modify the released code and do not touch the original source code. The following tools are now available:</p>

<p>When it comes to productivity software, Microsoft 365 and Google Docs are household names. They dominate the market, offering cloud-based document creation and collaboration with integrated services. But there’s a growing interest in alternatives that don&rsquo;t lock you into proprietary ecosystems. That’s where ONLYOFFICE Docs steps in.</p>

<p>Substack is an online platform that allows users to create and operate free and paid subscription newsletters. This platform had an open redirect vulnerability in its login flow which would redirect users to any sites after login completed. This could have been used by an attacker to facilitate phishing attacks targeting Substack users and steal their credentials.</p>

	<b><time>06.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of digital security, the adage &ldquo;patch or perish&rdquo; encapsulates a stark reality. The timely application of software patches is not just a best practice—it is a necessity. The vulnerabilities that lurk in unpatched software can serve as gateways for cybercriminals, leading to severe breaches, operational disruptions, and substantial financial losses.</p>
<p>The imperative to keep software up-to-date has never been more pressing, yet patch management often takes a backseat in organizations. It&rsquo;s not merely a technical oversight; it&rsquo;s a question of diligence and prioritization.</p>

<p>Normally, you have a choice with PCB prototypes: fast or cheap. [Stephen Hawes] has been trying fiber lasers to create PCBs. He’s learned a lot which he shares in the video below. Very good-looking singled-sided boards take just a few minutes. Fiber lasers are not cheap but they are within range for well-off hackers and certainly possible for a well-funded hackerspace.</p>
<p>One thing that’s important is to use FR1 phenolic substrate instead of the more common FR4. FR4 uses epoxy which will probably produce some toxic fumes under the laser.</p>

		<p>Renowned mathematician and quantum computing pioneer Peter W. Shor PhD ’85 has been named the recipient of MIT’s 2022-2023 James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award, the highest honor the Institute faculty can bestow upon one of its members each academic year.</p>
<p>The Killian Award citation credits Shor, who is the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics, with having made “seminal contributions that have forever shaped the foundations of quantum computing. Indeed, quantum computing exists today, in practice, because of Peter Shor.”</p>

		<p>Peter Shor, the Morss Professor of Applied Mathematics at MIT, has been named a recipient of the 2023 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. He shares the $3 million prize with three others for “foundational work in the field of quantum information”: David Deutsch at the University of Oxford, Charles Bennett at IBM Research, and Gilles Brassard of the University of Montreal.</p>
<p>In announcing the award, the Breakthrough Prize Foundation highlighted Shor’s contributions to the quantum information field, including the eponymous Shor’s algorithm for factoring extremely large numbers, and for an algorithm to correct errors in quantum computers.</p>

		<p>About five years ago, Areg Danagoulian, associate professor in the MIT Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE), became intrigued by a technique developed by researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory that uses a neutron beam to identify unknown materials.</p>
<p>“They could look into a black box containing uranium and say what kind and how much,” says Danagoulian, who directs MIT’s Laboratory of Applied Nuclear Physics (LANPh). “I was thinking about the problem of verifying nuclear material in warheads, and it just dawned on me, this amazing technology could be applied to what we’re working on.”</p>
