	<b><time>15.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple Vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Avalanche, the most severe of which could allow for authentication bypass. Ivanti Avalanche is a mobile device management system. Network security features allow one to manage wireless settings (including encryption and authentication) and apply those settings on a schedule throughout the network. Successful exploitation could allow for a remote unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication. Depending on the privileges associated with the logged-on user, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity researchers have found that bad actors are continuing to have success by spoofing sender email addresses as part of various malspam campaigns.</p>
<p>Faking the sender address of an email is widely seen as an attempt to make the digital missive more legitimate and get past security mechanisms that could otherwise flag it as malicious.</p>
<p>While there are safeguards such as DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC), and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) that can be used to prevent spammers from spoofing well-known domains, such measures have increasingly led them to leverage old, neglected domains in their operations.</p>

		<p>Back in March I was fortunate to spend several days visiting Brussels, where I had a chance to attend a panel on “chat control“: the new content scanning regime being considered by the EU Commission. Among various requirements, this proposed legislation would mandate that <em>client-side scanning</em> technology be incorporated into encrypted text messaging applications like Signal, WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. The scanning tech would examine private messages for certain types of illicit content, including child sexual abuse media (known as CSAM), along with a broad category of textual conversations that constitute “grooming behavior.”</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>On the gap between terms in an addition chain</strong><br>
<em>Theophilus Agama</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we study the distribution of the textit{gap} between terms in an addition chain. In particular, we show that if $1,2,ldots,s_{delta(n)}=n$ is an addition chain of length $delta(n)$ leading to $n$, then $$underset{1leq lleq delta(n)}{mathrm{sup}}(s_{l+k}-s_l)gg kfrac{n}{delta(n)}$$ and $$underset{1leq lleq delta(n)}{mathrm{inf}}(s_{l+k}-s_l)ll kfrac{n}{delta(n)}$$ for fixed $kgeq 1$.</p>

<p>What can a forensic expert find in an Outlook data file? Can they recover deleted emails, contacts and appointments from Microsoft Outlook? Can users erase unwanted correspondence from Outlook? In this article, we’ll demonstrate how experts can recover valuable information from Outlook data files (PST/OST), including deleted emails, contacts, attachments, and appointments. Even when users attempt to erase unwanted correspondence, traces often remain within the database. With the right tools, experts can extract and analyze this hidden data to uncover critical evidence.</p>

<p>Our blog features numerous articles on breaking passwords and accessing encrypted data, ranging from simple “how-to” guides to comprehensive manuals. However, many of the questions we are frequently asked are not about the technical stuff but rather the very basics of password recovery. Can you break that password? Is it legal? How much time do you think it will take to break this one? We do have the answers, but they require digging through the extensive content of our blog. To address this, we’ve created a comprehensive A to Z article that not only answers many common questions but also links to our previous posts.</p>
