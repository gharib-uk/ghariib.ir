		<p>If you&rsquo;re weighing up whether you should get a NAS or a DAS for your media library, this might help you make up your mind.</p>
<p>Self-hosting your own data can be a rewarding experience, knowing that you control all of it and can upgrade the amount of storage you have as you need to. However, you may be weighing whether you should get a NAS or a DAS, and there are pros and cons when it comes to a DAS specifically.</p>

		<p>Krita hidden features that can boost efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>Krita is a fantastic open-source tool for creative image manipulation. While Krita is one of many alternatives to Photoshop, it stands alone as a go-to creative tool for many digital artists and illustrators, even for digital illustration from tabletstoo. Krita has many obvious tools and features, like layers, brushes, shapes, and selection tools, but it also provides many hidden features you should use to boost your creative workflow further.</p>

	<div>
		<p>If you&rsquo;re self-hosting any services, you&rsquo;ll want a reverse proxy as another layer of defense.</p>
<p>Once your home network starts getting more complex, like if you were to start self-hosting apps and services, you might want to consider setting up a reverse proxy to shield those services from the internet. This is essentially another server that sits between the device your self-hosted apps are on and the internet, but instead of providing access outward to the internet, it provides access to those apps.</p>

		<p>Android 14 was released to the public by the Open Handset Alliance on October 4, 2023, and is now available on various smartphones, including the Google Pixel.</p>
<p>This blog post aims to explore a list of the majr oartifacts you can find on this version of the Android OS. </p>
<p>For testing and review, I set up a Google Pixel 7A and used it for about a month, with a SIM card and various native and third-party apps installed.</p>

		<p>This has been a tough year for me: my mom passed away in June, and I&rsquo;m still slowly recovering from the hard blow. It&rsquo;s time to start again doing what I love: researching and sharing!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early September and like every year, that moment is approaching when everyone who deals with mobile forensics starts to tremble at the thought of the arrival of a new version of iOS!</p>
<p>First the good news: the basic and traditional techniques for logical acquisition (or Advanced Logical, if you want to call it that) still work on iOS 18!</p>

		<p><strong>Update</strong> <strong>(April 19):</strong> <em>Yilei Chen announced the discovery of a bug in the algorithm, which he does not know how to fix. This was independently discovered by Hongxun Wu and Thomas Vidick. At present, the paper does not provide a polynomial-time algorithm for solving LWE.</em></p>
<p>If you’re a normal person — that is, a person who doesn’t obsessively follow the latest cryptography news — you probably missed last week’s cryptography bombshell. That news comes in the form of a new e-print authored by Yilei Chen, “Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems“, which has roiled the cryptography research community. The result is now being evaluated by experts in lattices and quantum algorithm design (<em>and to be clear, I am not one!</em>) but if it holds up, it’s going to be quite a bad day/week/month/year for the applied cryptography community.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>ABLE: Optimizing Mixed Arithmetic and Boolean Garbled Circuit</strong><br>
<em>Jianqiao Cambridge Mo, Brandon Reagen</em></p>
<p>Privacy and security have become critical priorities in many scenarios. Privacy-preserving computation (PPC) is a powerful solution that allows functions to be computed directly on encrypted data. Garbled circuit (GC) is a key PPC technology that enables secure, confidential computing. GC comes in two forms: Boolean GC supports all operations by expressing functions as logic circuits; arithmetic GC is a newer technique to efficiently compute a set of arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication. Mixed GC combines both Boolean and arithmetic GC, in an attempt to optimize performance by computing each function in its most natural form. However, this introduces additional costly conversions between the two forms. It remains unclear if and when the efficiency gains of arithmetic GC outweigh these conversion costs.</p>

		<p>During the forensic examination of a smartphone, we sometimes need to understand some basic settings of the device. Some simple examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of the device?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time zone automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data switched on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data roaming switched on or off?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Android devices, most of these settings are managed centrally by the Android settings provider. </p>

		<p>During the forensic analysis of a mobile device, we often have the need to understand the content of a specific file or folder. This is particularly true when a file or a folder is not parsed by our set of tools. </p>
<p>Our approach is, typically, to start googling the file or folder name to check if someone else has already done some researches on it. This approach is time consuming and it&rsquo;s not always easy to quickly find the proper reference. I also realized that I googled the same file/folder name multiple times&hellip;..</p>
