<p>In this first blog post about <em>DNS rebinding</em> topic,  we are going to show a practical example of <strong>DNS Rebinding attack against UPnP services</strong> exposed in a local network. </p>
<p>The goal  of this post series is to show real attack scenarios against devices exposing services on a local network. </p>
<p>That case study tends to happen usually on <strong>IoT interconnected home or smart office devices</strong>, which are a very interesting scenario from an attacker perspective.</p>

<p>In the first part, after a fast overview on the <em>DNS Rebinding</em> technique, we considered a practical example in which UPnP services has been exploited to perform NAT Injection attacks and, therefore, expose internal services on Internet.</p>
<p>In this second post we are going to demonstrate how <em>DNS Rebinding</em> could be used to exploit vulnerable services running locally in order to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). </p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>A Survey on Transciphering and Symmetric Ciphers for Homomorphic Encryption</strong><br>
<em>Indranil Thakur, Angshuman Karmakar, Chaoyun Li, Bart Preneel</em></p>
<p>Data privacy concerns are sharply rising in the current digital era, hyperdriven by cloud computing, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as an ideal technique for computing on encrypted data, but current schemes suffer from slow encryption speed and large ciphertext expansion. Practical implementation is hindered, especially when the client has limited bandwidth, memory, and computing power. In 2011, Naehrig et al. proposed transciphering, reducing computational and communication overload on the client side. This involves symmetric ciphers with minimized multiplicative complexity, referred to as HE-Friendly Ciphers (HEFCs).</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Adaptive Hardcore Bit and Quantum Key Leasing over Classical Channel from LWE with Polynomial Modulus</strong><br>
<em>Duong Hieu Phan, Weiqiang Wen, Xingyu Yan, Jinwei Zheng</em></p>
<p>Quantum key leasing, also known as public key encryption with secure key leasing (PKE-SKL), allows a user to lease a (quantum) secret key to a server for decryption purpose, with the capability of revoking the key afterwards. In the pioneering work by Chardouvelis et al (arXiv:2310.14328), a PKE-SKL scheme utilizing classical channels was successfully built upon the noisy trapdoor claw-free (NTCF) family. This approach, however, relies on the superpolynomial hardness of learning with errors (LWE) problem, which could affect both efficiency and security of the scheme.</p>

<p>As we approach 2025, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is set to dramatically reshape the cyber security landscape. As an AI and cyber security expert, I foresee several key developments that will significantly impact our digital world. The surge in AI usage will have far-reaching implications for areas such as energy consumption, software development, and ethical and legal frameworks. Of course, AI technologies will also be weaponized by cyber criminals and nation state actors, creating new and formidable threats to cyber security. The AI Explosion The adoption of AI technologies is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. ChatGPT, for […]</p>

		<p>It’s just become even more important to be conscious about the pictures we post online.</p>
<p>GeoSpy is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) supported tool that can derive a person’s location by analyzing features in a photo like vegetation, buildings, and other landmarks. And it can do so in seconds based on one picture.</p>
<p>Graylark Technologies who makes GeoSpy says it’s been developed for government and law enforcement. But the investigative journalists from 404 Media report that the tool has also been used for months by members of the public, with many making videos marveling at the technology, and some asking for help with stalking specific women.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 21, 2025</p>
<p>With cybercrime costs projected to reach an astronomical $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, the stakes have never been higher.</p>
<p>DailyFT, Sri Lanka’s first and only national daily business paper, reports that AI’s market value is expected to surpass $ 1.5 trillion within the same timeframe, underlining its growing dominance in every industry. This convergence represents a dual-edged sword: while AI offers unprecedented capabilities for detecting, preventing, and mitigating cyber threats, it also equips malicious actors with new tools for sophisticated attacks.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>An Introduction to Protein Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Hayder Tirmazi, Tien Phuoc Tran</em></p>
<p>We introduce protein cryptography, a recently proposed method that encodes data into the amino acid sequences of proteins. Unlike traditional digital encryption, this approach relies on the inherent diversity, complexity, and replication resistance of biological macromolecules, making them highly secure against duplication or tampering. The experimental realization of protein cryptography remains an open problem. To accelerate experimental progress in this area, we provide an accessible and self-contained introduction to the fundamentals of cryptography for biologists with limited mathematical and computational backgrounds. Furthermore, we outline a framework for encoding, synthesizing, and decoding information using proteins. By enabling biologists to actively engage in the development of protein cryptography, this work bridges disciplinary boundaries and paves the way for applications in secure data storage.</p>
