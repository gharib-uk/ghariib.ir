		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>An Introduction to Protein Cryptography</strong><br>
<em>Hayder Tirmazi, Tien Phuoc Tran</em></p>
<p>We introduce protein cryptography, a recently proposed method that encodes data into the amino acid sequences of proteins. Unlike traditional digital encryption, this approach relies on the inherent diversity, complexity, and replication resistance of biological macromolecules, making them highly secure against duplication or tampering. The experimental realization of protein cryptography remains an open problem. To accelerate experimental progress in this area, we provide an accessible and self-contained introduction to the fundamentals of cryptography for biologists with limited mathematical and computational backgrounds. Furthermore, we outline a framework for encoding, synthesizing, and decoding information using proteins. By enabling biologists to actively engage in the development of protein cryptography, this work bridges disciplinary boundaries and paves the way for applications in secure data storage.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Artificial Results From Hardware Synthesis</strong><br>
<em>Ahmed Alharbi, Charles Bouillaguet</em></p>
<p>In this paper, we revisit venerable lower-bounds on the $AT$ or $AT^2$ performance metric of hardware circuits. A series of works started in the late 1970&rsquo;s has established that if a hardware circuit of area $A$ computes a function $f : {0, 1}^n rightarrow {0, 1}^m$ in $T$ clock cycles, then $AT^2$ is asymptotically larger than (a form of) the communication complexity of $f$. These lower-bounds ignore the active component of the circuit such as the logic gates and only take into account the area of the wiring.</p>

<p>Last month, we presented at Hack In Paris (France) a XML External Entities (XXE) exploitation workshop. It showcase methods to exploit XXE with numerous obstacles. Today, we present our method to exploit XXEs with a local Document Type Declaration (DTD) file. More specifically, how we built a huge list of reusable DTD files.</p>
<p>XML External Entities (XXE) is a type of attack done against an application that parses XML input. It occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity (SYSTEM entity) is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. Over the years, researchers have found multiple ways to exfiltrate content using various XML payloads:</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Available Attestation: Towards a Reorg-Resilient Solution for Ethereum Proof-of-Stake</strong><br>
<em>Mingfei Zhang, Rujia Li, Xueqian Lu, Sisi Duan</em></p>
<p>Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work consensus to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus in September 2022. While this upgrade brings significant improvements (e.g., lower energy costs and higher throughput), it also introduces new vulnerabilities. One notable example is the so-called malicious textit{reorganization attack}. Malicious reorganization denotes an attack in which the Byzantine faulty validators intentionally manipulate the canonical chain so the blocks by honest validators are discarded. By doing so, the faulty validators can gain benefits such as higher rewards, lower chain quality, or even posing a liveness threat to the system.</p>

	<b><time>22.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re hearing from infrastructure teams: they&rsquo;re tired. Tired of complexity. Tired of unpredictable costs. Tired of feeling locked into decisions made years ago. VMware&rsquo;s recent pricing adjustments didn&rsquo;t start these conversations, but they&rsquo;ve brought them into sharper focus. Teams are ready for a simpler approach.</p>
<p>At Giant Swarm, we believe bare metal Kubernetes offers a compelling path forward. By removing the hypervisor layer and embracing the open source flexibility of Kubernetes, businesses can achieve significant cost savings, reduce dependency on single-vendor solutions, and unlock new opportunities for scalability and innovation. </p>

		<p>Did you know? — Recent research shows that 80% of cyberattacks happen due to unpatched software vulnerabilities. This highlights the critical role of automated patch management software in safeguarding systems. These tools not only streamline updates but also fortify your systems against evolving cyber threats. In this article, we’ll talk about the best automated patch […]</p>

<p>This February, we ran a Find Security Bugs scan on over at least one hundred components from the Spring Framework, including the core components (spring-core, spring-mvc) but also optional components (spring-data, spring-social, spring-oauth, etc.). From this exercise, we reported some vulnerabilities. In this blog post, we are going to give more details on a SpEL injection vulnerability. While some proof of concept code and exploitation details have already surfaced on Twitter, we will add a focus on how these vulnerabilities were found, followed by a thorough review of the proposed fix.</p>
