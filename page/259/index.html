		<p>During the forensic examination of a smartphone, we sometimes need to understand some basic settings of the device. Some simple examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of the device?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is the &ldquo;Set time zone automatically&rdquo; option on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data switched on or off?</li>
<li>Is mobile data roaming switched on or off?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Android devices, most of these settings are managed centrally by the Android settings provider. </p>

		<p>During the forensic analysis of a mobile device, we often have the need to understand the content of a specific file or folder. This is particularly true when a file or a folder is not parsed by our set of tools. </p>
<p>Our approach is, typically, to start googling the file or folder name to check if someone else has already done some researches on it. This approach is time consuming and it&rsquo;s not always easy to quickly find the proper reference. I also realized that I googled the same file/folder name multiple times&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Naturalist John Muir once said, “The mountains are calling, and I must go…” I could not agree more, John.</p>
<p>There is something about the joy of tackling tough challenges. For me, that call has taken me from Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to Machu Picchu in Peru to Everest Base Camp in Nepal (I thought about Taylor Swift Eras tour tickets but alas was not brave enough). In my personal journeys, there is no greater joy than realizing the payoff from all your hard work by reaching the summit – except perhaps in being able to share your joy with others who are on the journey with you!</p>

		<p>It’s been a while since I wrote an “attack of the week” post, and the fault for this is entirely mine. I’ve been much too busy writing boring posts about Schnorr signatures! But this week’s news brings an exciting story with both technical <em>and</em> political dimensions: new reports claim that Chinese security agencies have developed a technique to trace the sender of AirDrop transmissions.</p>
<p>Typically my “attack of the week” posts are intended to highlight recent research. What’s unusual about this one is that the attack is not really <em>new</em>; it was discovered way back in 2019, when a set of TU Darmstadt researchers — Heinrich, Hollick, Schneider, Stute, and Weinert — reverse-engineered the Apple AirDrop protocol and disclosed several privacy flaws to Apple. (The resulting paper, which appeared in Usenix Security 2021 can be found here.)</p>

<p>When it comes to DIY projects, nothing beats the thrill of crafting something that rivals expensive commercial products. In the microphone build video below, [Electronoobs] found himself inspired by DIY Perks earlier efforts. He took on the challenge of building a $20 high-quality microphone—a budget-friendly alternative to models priced at $500. The result: an engaging and educational journey that has it’s moments of triumph, it’s challenges, and of course, opportunities for improvement.</p>
