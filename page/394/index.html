		<p>Canonical is pleased to announce security patching and support for Valkey through the Ubuntu Pro subscription. Ubuntu Pro is a subscription for open source software security, compliance and support that expands the maintenance period for all packages distributed in Ubuntu repositories. This extension applies to all the open source software on Ubuntu, including Valkey.</p>
<p>This means that Valkey users can now benefit from the following features offered with Ubuntu Pro:</p>

We’re seeing something of a terminal emulator renaissance of late, with developers eager to reimagine, rethink, and rewire the humble console to leverage modern hardware, GPU acceleration, containerised workflows, and (in some cases) AI/LLMs. Ghostty, a new open-source and cross-platform terminal application created by Mitchell Hashimoto (co-founder of HashiCorp) is the latest to join the fray. Hashimoto’s says he “set out to build a terminal emulator that was fast, feature-rich, and had a platform-native GUI while still being cross-platform.” The first public release materialised over Christmas, rather like a festive Dickensian spook seeking to give us a glimpse into the […]</p>

		<p>Elections define the course of democracies (even as there are several types of democracies), and 2024 was a landmark year, with over 60 countries — plus the European Union — holding national elections, impacting half the world’s population. As highlighted in Pew Research’s global elections report, this was a year of “political disruption,” where the Internet was a relevant stage for both democratic engagement and cyber threats.</p>
<p>At Cloudflare, with our presence in over 330 cities and 120 countries and interconnection with 12,500 networks, we’ve witnessed firsthand the digital impact of these elections. From monitoring Internet traffic patterns to mitigating cyberattacks, we’ve observed trends that reveal how elections increasingly play out online. As detailed in our just-published Cloudflare Impact report, we’ve also worked to protect media outlets, political campaigns, and help elections worldwide.</p>

Loupe (aka Image Viewer) is GNOME’s modern successor to the venerable Eye of GNOME has picked up its first batch of image editing features. The features in question were only recently merged upstream, aren’t finished, and not yet included in a stable build. But they’re an interesting addition that furthers the likelihood that Loupe could become the default image viewer on Ubuntu. At present, Ubuntu continues to use Eye of GNOME as the default tool for opening and browsing image files on desktop, despite Loupe having officially replaced it upstream in the GNOME project as a GNOME Core app. Loupe […]</p>

<p>Back in 2021, we covered the antics of Grinch Bots and how the combination of proposed regulation and technology could prevent these malicious programs from stealing holiday cheer.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2024 — the Stop Grinch Bots Act of 2021 has not passed, and bots are more active and powerful than ever, leaving businesses to fend off increasingly sophisticated attacks on their own. During Black Friday 2024, Cloudflare observed:</p>

		<p>In late November 2024, Anthropic announced a new way to interact with AI, called Model Context Protocol (MCP). Today, we’re excited to show you how to use MCP in combination with Cloudflare to extend the capabilities of Claude to build applications, generate images and more. You’ll learn how to build an MCP server on Cloudflare to make any service accessible through an AI assistant like Claude with just a few lines of code using Cloudflare Workers. </p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In today’s complex cybersecurity landscape, organizations face a critical challenge when security incidents occur: determining when and how to report to regulators and other oversight bodies. This decision can have significant implications for compliance, reputation, and legal liability. A virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) can provide invaluable assistance in navigating these waters. Here’s how:</p>
<h2 id="1-regulatory-expertise"> 1. Regulatory Expertise</h2>
<p>A vCISO brings deep knowledge of various regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and industry-specific regulations. They stay current on reporting requirements and can quickly assess which regulations apply to your specific incident.</p>

		<p><em>This ongoing</em> <em>Docker Labs GenAI series</em> <em>explores the exciting space of AI developer tools. At Docker, we believe there is a vast scope to explore, openly and without the hype. We will share our explorations and collaborate with the developer community in real time. Although developers have adopted autocomplete tooling like GitHub Copilot and use chat, there is significant potential for AI tools to assist with more specific tasks and interfaces throughout the entire software lifecycle. Therefore, our exploration will be broad. We will be releasing software as open source so you can play, explore, and hack with us, too.</em></p>
