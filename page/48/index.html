<p>According to ESET APT Activity Report Q2 2024-Q3 2024, China-linked threat groups dominate global APT campaigns, with MustangPanda responsible for 12% of activity during the observed quarters of 2024. Another nefarious China-backed APT group tracked as MirrorFace (aka Earth Kasha) has been observed expanding its geographical reach to target the diplomatic agency in the EU using ANEL backdoor. The offensive adversary campaign, which was uncovered in the late summer of 2024, came into the spotlight known as the AkaiRyū operation (Japanese for RedDragon).</p>

<p>“If Global Cybercrime Inc. traded on a stock exchange, I would buy it because its growth trajectory over the past decade has been breathtaking,” writes Steven Ellliott, an executive at ADAMnetworks. “Measured by GDP, global cybercrime is now a $10.5 trillion-per-year economy, according to Cybersecurity Ventures, trailing only the U.S. and China in economic productivity.”</p>

<p>As operational technology (OT) environments rapidly evolve, security strategies must keep pace with emerging risks and operational challenges. The modernization of OT calls for a fresh approach that goes beyond asset visibility to ensure resilience, safety and uptime. Protecting industrial infrastructure, especially environments with legacy systems, distributed operations and remote workforces, requires security strategies that address real-world threats, adapt to operational constraints, and support long-term reliability.</p>

		<p>Accessing private content online, whether it&rsquo;s checking email or streaming your favorite show, almost always starts with a “login” step. Beneath this everyday task lies a widespread human mistake we still have not resolved: <strong>password reuse.</strong> Many users recycle passwords across multiple services, creating a ripple effect of risk when their credentials are leaked.</p>
<p>Based on Cloudflare&rsquo;s observed traffic between September - November 2024, <strong>41% of successful logins across websites protected by Cloudflare involve compromised passwords.</strong> In this post, we’ll explore the widespread impact of password reuse, focusing on how it affects popular Content Management Systems (CMS), the behavior of bots versus humans in login attempts, and how attackers exploit stolen credentials to take over accounts at scale.</p>

		<p>Recently, when my workplace laptop needed a hardware refresh and I wanted to replace it with an ARM-based laptop with Linux (a MacBook), I was tasked with comparing the efficiency of using CPU virtualization versus emulation.This article presents my research and benchmark data comparing the performance and power consumption of workloads running under virtualization and emulation.We live in exciting times: After many years with the x86 architecture dominating the market, there are new players. For some years, Amazon has been offering Graviton instances, which consists of using an ARM-based CPU</p>

		<p>Job Posting: <strong>Ph.D. position in Hardware Security (Verification)</strong><br>
<em>Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Bochum, Germany</em></p>
<p>The newly established junior research group on <em>Computer-Aided Verification of Physical Security Properties (CAVE)</em> is looking for excellent Ph.D. candidates in the area of hardware security, particularly (but not limited to) those specialized in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware Security Verification: We explore how to perform efficient pre-silicon security verification with respect to physical implementation attacks (Side-Channel Analysis / Fault-Injection Analysis).</li>
<li>Physical Implementation Attacks: We deepen the (theoretical) understanding of active and passive physical implementation attacks to build formal attacker models for security verification.</li>
<li>Secure Hardware Design: We investigate how to build secure hardware circuits that can resist physical implementation attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in applying, please send an email to Dr. Pascal Sasdrich (<a href="mailto:pascal.sasdrich@rub.de">pascal.sasdrich@rub.de</a>) with the following documents in a single PDF (max. 10 MB) and subject line &ldquo;[CAVE] Application for PhD position&rdquo;:</p>
