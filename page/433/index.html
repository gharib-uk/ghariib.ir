		<p>The adoption of cloud-native methodologies, processes and tools has been a challenge for communications service providers (CSPs), aka telcos or network operators.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Telcos are embracing cloud-native processes and tools</strong></li>
<li><strong>It’s part of their evolution towards being digital service providers</strong></li>
<li><strong>But the cloud-native journey is still in its early stages</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real cultural change is needed if telcos are to capitalise fully on the cloud-native opportunities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside a a session, Why cloud native is essential to delivering the automation, agility and innovation needed to support new services, at Telco TV’s DSP Leaders World Forum event in Windsor, UK, a poll was taken.  The following question was asked, <strong>“How can Digital Service Providers maximize the cloud-native opportunities?”</strong>  Respondents were able to select all the options they deemed relevant.  Here are the results:</p>

		<p>Methods to recover access to a hacked Telegram account</p>
<p>Account hijacking in Telegram has become a serious criminal business in today’s world. Scammers employ sophisticated methods to steal access to accounts, and then use them to attack other users through deepfakes, social engineering, and other techniques. Here’s how it typically works: having stolen an account, scammers send phishing messages to all its contacts — such as <em>“Hi, I urgently need money. Can you help me?”</em>, <em>Please vote for me if you have a moment</em> or <em>You’ve received a gift – a one-year subscription to Telegram Premium</em> — to hijack even more accounts.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>With generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) on the frontlines of information security, red teams play an essential role in identifying vulnerabilities that others can overlook.</p>
<p>With the average cost of a data breach reaching an all-time high of $4.88 million in 2024, businesses need to know exactly where their vulnerabilities lie. Given the remarkable pace at which they’re adopting gen AI, there’s a good chance that some of those vulnerabilities lie in AI models themselves — or the data used to train them.</p>

<p>DEF CON 32 has wound down, and we want to thank our community for making this one stellar. You never fail to bring gigantic love and enthusiasm to every aspect of the Con, and we are inspired by your example.</p>
<p>The curveball of a sudden, late-stage venue scramble could have spelled disaster, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Having so much of the Con back under one roof felt great! FIrst years in a new venue always mean some hiccups and learning experiences, but you reacted with patience and grace when they happened. For this you have our eternal gratitude.</p>

		<p>Privacy-enhanced alternatives to Office, WhatsApp and Evernote for Christmas and New Year gifts.</p>
<p>With just a few days left before Christmas, overwhelmed shipping services might fail to deliver your gifts on time. Of course, you could always get a last-minute digital gift-card or subscription — but the fact is that everyone who might be interested in a Netflix or Spotify account probably already has one. And Telegram Premium? That’s a little awkward just now.</p>

		<p>A Divisive Veto: California Rejects AI Safety Bill SB 1047 California Governor Gavin Newsom’s recent veto of SB 1047, a proposed AI safety bill, has sparked a hot debate on the balance between innovation and regulation in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. California has over a dozen AI related bills that have been signed although this bill sought to establish rigorous safety testing requirements for large-scale AI models and introduce an emergency &ldquo;kill switch&rdquo; for situations where systems might become dangerous. Newsom’s veto shines a light on the ongoing tensions between the tech&hellip;</p>

		<p>At Fortra, we like to encourage a collaborative environment. One of the ways we bring our community together is through our Transformer meetups which aim to provide a positive, energizing, and fun hub for all Fortra employees to learn how to be innovative, get inspired by others, and reach their creative potential. Our most recent meetup was moderated by myself and our panelists were Tyler Reguly, John Wilson, Bob Erdman, and Nathan Ramaker. The conversation was so insightful, that we wanted to share some of the discussion with others in this blog. Joe Pettit: October was National&hellip;</p>
