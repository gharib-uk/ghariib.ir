		<p>In a recent post titled &ldquo;From Assistant to Analyst: The Power of Gemini 1.5 Pro for Malware Analysis&rdquo;, published on the Google Cloud Security blog, we explore the capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro, which enhances malware analysis by processing up to 1 million tokens. This advancement allows the tool to analyze large amounts of disassembled or decompiled code in a single pass, providing a complete view of the malware&rsquo;s logic to produce verdicts and summary reports. The blog post highlights practical applications of this approach, using well-known malware such as WannaCry and also entirely new and previously undetected malware. These examples show that Gemini 1.5 Pro&rsquo;s reports are not based on pre-trained data of those specific samples but on its ability to analyze the code itself. For more details on how Gemini 1.5 Pro operates in malware analysis, we encourage you to read the complete post here.</p>

<p>When using cryptography to protect data, protocol designers often prefer symmetric keys and algorithms for their speed and efficiency. However, when data is exchanged across an untrusted network such as the internet, it becomes difficult to ensure that <em>only</em> the exchanging parties can know the same key. Asymmetric key pairs and algorithms help to solve this problem by allowing a public key to be shared over an untrusted network. And by using a key agreement scheme, two parties can use each other’s public key in combination with their own private key to each derive the same shared secret.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Asymptotically Optimal Adaptive Asynchronous Common Coin and DKG with Silent Setup</strong><br>
<em>Hanwen Feng, Qiang Tang</em></p>
<p>This paper presents the first optimal-resilient, adaptively secure asynchronous common coin protocol with $O(lambda n^2)$ communication complexity and $O(1)$ rounds, requiring only a public silent setup. Our protocol immediately implies a sequence of quadratic-communication, constant-round asynchronous Byzantine agreement protocols and asynchronous distributed key generation with a silent setup. Along the way, we formulate a new primitive called asynchronous subset alignment and introduce a simple framework to reason about specific composition security suitable for asynchronous common coin, which may be of independent interest.</p>
