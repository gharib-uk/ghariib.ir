	<div>
		<p>Survey data and discussions with enterprise networking professionals reveal they are still grappling with many networking issues spawned by the expansion of the cloud – the most common of which include <strong>securing connections</strong> for remote work, implementing zero-trust security strategies, and integrating myriad cloud and wide-area networks (WANs).</p>
<p>For example, in <strong>Futuriom’s</strong> latest survey of 196 enterprise IT and networking professionals, more than 80% said the complexity of connecting the wide variety of networks was a large challenge. At nearly 70% of responses, expertise and knowledge was the second-largest challenge (multiple responses were allowed), and cost was cited by 60%.  Please refer to survey highlights below.</p>

<p>As we prepare to step into 2025, cloud security continues to remodel in response to emerging needs – the wide adoption of AI, regulatory demands and increasing cyberthreats. Our company’s cloud security leaders are on the heels of these threats with Palo Alto Networks global 2025 predictions, laying out the top cloud security predictions for the coming year.</p>
<p>In the year ahead, protecting cloud environments won’t just be the top priority – it will be imperative. With organizations moving substantial amounts of data for AI-driven workflows to the cloud, the dependency on cloud infrastructures has taken on new depths. This shift, coupled with the expanding attack surface, has magnified the importance of comprehensive strategies for cloud security.</p>

<p>Flying a first-person view (FPV) remote controlled aircraft with goggles is an immersive experience that makes you feel as if you’re really sitting in the cockpit of the plane or quadcopter. Unfortunately, while your wearing the goggles, you’re also completely blind to the world around you. That’s why you’re supposed to have a spotter nearby to keep watch on the local meatspace while you’re looping through the air.</p>
<p>But what if you could have the best of both worlds? What if your goggles not only allowed you to see the video stream from your craft’s FPV camera, but you could also see the world around you. That’s precisely the idea behind mixed reality goggles such as Apple Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest, you just need to put all the pieces together. In a recent video [Hoarder Sam] shows you exactly how to pull it off, and we have to say, the results look quite compelling.</p>

<p>Houston, we have a problem: implementing DevSecOps isn’t as straightforward as it seems.</p>
<p>DevSecOps has redefined security in modern software development, becoming the benchmark for organizational success. By embedding security into every phase of the development lifecycle, organizations can deploy faster and collaborate more efficiently while ensuring security at every step. Yet, despite its advantages, according to IDC’s 2024 DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security Survey, only 66% of application development teams use DevSecOps methodologies on average. If it were easy to implement, that number would be much closer to 100%. So, what’s holding teams back? Let’s explore the most common challenges—and how to address them. </p>
