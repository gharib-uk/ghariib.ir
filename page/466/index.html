		<p>Perhaps even the cyber-criminals are effected by the recent recession – botnets for hire are hitting rock-bottom rates starting at just $2. We reported back in April 2010 about the Texas Man Who Pleaded Guilty To Bot Network For Hire. They are becoming more multi-talented as well rather than just offering bot networks for DDoS […]</p>

		<p>Good Tech Inc. has realised its machines were vulnerable. They have decided to deploy a permanent VAPT machine within their network, where contractors can remotely access to perform the necessary vulnerability assessment scans.</p>
<p>However, this has not been the most secure deployment. Can you root this machine?</p>
<p>If you MUST have hints for this machine: ELECTRICAL is (#1): well-intentioned but horrible in execution, (#2): has multiple paths to privilege escalation, (#3): how you should not configure vendor configurations for VAPT work.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get into flying first-person view (FPV) remote controlled aircraft, there’s an incredible amount of information available online. Seriously, it’s ridiculous. In fact, between the different forums and the countless YouTube videos out there, it can be difficult to sort through the noise and actually find the information you need.</p>
<p>What if there was one location where FPV folks could look up hardware, compare notes, and maybe even meet up for the occasional flight? That’s the idea behind the recently launched DIYFPV. In its current state the website is a cross between a social media platform, a hardware database, and a tech support forum.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It’s easy to tick the checkboxes on a compliance checklist with the mindset that your system is protected and not exposed to risk. If it is this simple, why do we continue to invest billions of dollars in developing security controls and software development lifecycle (SDL) practices that help harden software and minimize risk? What is the value in configuring services, tuning firewalls, and enforcing access policies only to accept a risk rating for a vulnerability directly mapped to a base score that seemingly ignores all the work done?This contradictory model of focusing on security featur</p>
