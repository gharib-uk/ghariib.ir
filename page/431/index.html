<p>Good news, everyone! We’ve already got some discounted room blocks you can use to lock down your lodgings for DEF CON 33.</p>
<p>DC33 doesn’t kick off until August 7, 2025, but that’s no reason to lollygag. If you’re a high-octane go-getter you already know how good it feels to get those To-Do items checked off early. If not, this is far enough ahead to forget you booked and give yourself a nice surprise when there’s one less thing to do at crunch time.</p>

<p>As OT environments become more interconnected, organizations can manage operations remotely, enhancing efficiency and enabling greater oversight even from a distance. However, these advancements come with heightened security risks. A recent report from Palo Alto Networks and ABI Research found that 74% of respondents noticed an increase in remote access, creating more entry points for attackers. This expanded attack surface has made OT systems a prime target for cyber threats, underscoring the need for a robust security framework tailored to remote OT environments.</p>

<p>As we prepare to say goodbye to 2024, the state of security operations continues to evolve and adapt as organizations face increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and early signs of cybercriminal adoption of AI. Current solutions often rely on siloed tools, and manual processes are proving inadequate in addressing the complexity and scale of modern threats. According to Unit 42, the time between initial compromise and data exfiltration is decreasing, and attackers are sometimes beginning to exfiltrate data in hours, not days. What does that mean for 2025?</p>

		<p>2024 has been a banner year for artificial intelligence (AI). As enterprises ramp up adoption, however, malicious actors have been exploring new ways to compromise systems with intelligent attacks.</p>
<p>With the AI landscape rapidly evolving, it’s worth looking back before moving forward. Here are our top five AI security stories for 2024.</p>
<h2 id="can-you-hear-me-now-hackers-hijack-audio-with-ai">Can you hear me now? Hackers hijack audio with AI</h2>
<p>Attackers can fake entire conversations using large language models (LLMs), voice cloning and speech-to-text software. This method is relatively easy to detect, however, so researchers at IBM X-Force carried out an experiment to determine if parts of a conversation can be captured and replaced in real-time.</p>
