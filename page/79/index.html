<p>Microsoft has started testing a new “scareware blocker” feature for the Edge web browser on Windows PCs, which uses machine learning (ML) to detect tech support scams.</p>
<p>Scareware scams (also known as tech support scams) have been a pervasive threat for years. The scammers use aggressive landing pages to persuade potential victims that their devices have been compromised with malware and then try to gain remote access to targets’ systems by pressuring them to call a fake tech support number.</p>

<p>The migration to OpenTofu is a straightforward process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install OpenTofu using your preferred package manager or download the binary from the OpenTofu releases page.</li>
<li>Update your scripts and CI/CD configurations to use the <code>tofu</code> command instead of <code>terraform</code>:</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># Before
terraform init

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Multi-Authority Functional Encryption with Bounded Collusions from Standard Assumptions</strong><br>
<em>Rishab Goyal, Saikumar Yadugiri</em></p>
<p>Multi-Authority Functional Encryption ($mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$) [Chase, TCC'07; Lewko-Waters, Eurocrypt'11; Brakerski et al., ITCS'17] is a popular generalization of functional encryption ($mathsf{FE}$) with the central goal of decentralizing the trust assumption from a single central trusted key authority to a group of multiple, independent and non-interacting, key authorities. Over the last several decades, we have seen tremendous advances in new designs and constructions for $mathsf{FE}$ supporting different function classes, from a variety of assumptions and with varying levels of security. Unfortunately, the same has not been replicated in the multi-authority setting. The current scope of $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ designs is rather limited, with positive results only known for (all-or-nothing) attribute-based functionalities, or need full power of general-purpose code obfuscation. This state-of-the-art in $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ could be explained in part by the implication provided by Brakerski et al. (ITCS'17). It was shown that a general-purpose obfuscation scheme can be designed from any $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ scheme for circuits, even if the $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ scheme is secure only in a bounded-collusion model, where at most two keys per authority get corrupted.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for privilege escalation. Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for privilege escalation in the context of the affected component. Depending on the privileges associated with the exploited component, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full rights. </p>

<p>Facebook is the most popular social network worldwide, outperforming every other competitor for reach and active users, according to Statista. Further, according to Sprout Social, Facebook is the third-most visited website following Google and YouTube. Thus, when a phishing campaign leverages the Facebook brand, the implications are particularly consequential. Email researchers at Check Point have recently discovered a new Facebook-focused phishing campaign, which has been sent to more than 12,279 email addresses and targets hundreds of companies. The campaign began around December 20th 2024 and has primarily affected enterprises across the EU (45.5%), US (45.0%) and Australia (9.5%). Nonetheless, versions […]</p>

<p>LevelBlue is pleased to announce the launch of the LevelBlue Threat Trends Report! This biannual report, which is a collaboration between various LevelBlue Security Operations teams, is a must-have for security practitioners at organizations of all sizes. It provides relevant, actionable information about ongoing threats as well as guidance on how organizations can work to secure themselves against these threats.</p>
<p>In this edition, our analysts review attacks and threat actor techniques observed by LevelBlue in the second half of 2024 (from June through November). Additionally, our Incident Response team, which provides support and guidance to customers during and after incidents, reviews 12 compromises, 10 of which involved known ransomware groups. In each case, the team recommends hardening and mitigation techniques that can be used to safeguard against these attacks.</p>
