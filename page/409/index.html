		<p>The world is fast moving towards an on-demand economy. Whether it’s on-demand movies or on-demand food, customers expect everything to be on-demand and instant. To keep up with such demands, applications must be able to serve information and process transactions at the same speed and accuracy as a professional barista crafting a perfect shot of espresso.</p>
<p>In such a high-speed scenario, where speed is paramount, traditional databases fall short of expectations. Their inherent latency and limited throughput can be a bottleneck.</p>

		<p>Developers at growing businesses face unique challenges, but building and scaling applications—whether it’s a cutting-edge AI app or a video streaming service—doesn’t have to be one of them. I’m excited to invite you to <strong>Deploy: Scaling With Simplicity</strong>, on January 22nd, 2025 in Austin, Texas. Deploy is DigitalOcean’s signature developer conference, now with an in-person option for more opportunities to connect and learn. Can’t join us in Austin? Don’t worry, Deploy is still available virtually as well—view the detailed agenda and register to join us today.</p>

		<p>Developer platforms reduce developers’ cognitive load by abstracting away the various complexities of infrastructure and the development process, eventually improving their productivity and workflow. However, building a developer platform can be complex, and organizations could fail at it the first time. The primary reason is the lack of proper communication between the team building the platform and the team that will use it. Another reason for failing at platform engineering is not having clarity on what is important and what should be added to the platform. What are the elements necessary to build a helpful developer platform? And no, platform engineering is not only about tools or IDPs.</p>

		<p>DigitalOcean has been providing a managed Kubernetes service since 2019. Over those years, our infrastructure has changed a huge amount, notably in the form of a new and improved Containerised Control Plane (CCP) architecture launched in 2021. In this post, we’ll explore the journey we took to the new architecture using an open source project called Cluster API. This was combined with some DigitalOcean ‘’’scrappy magic’’’ to provide a scalable, fault tolerant, managed Kubernetes service for customers. We’ve written about it in the past, but it’s time to dive in and swim through the details.</p>

		<p>Memory unsafe languages are those that do not handle any memory management on behalf of the developer. For example, when programming in C or C++, if you need memory during runtime, you will need to allocate and deallocate the memory yourself, running the risk of ending up with memory leaks in cases when you inadvertently forget to deallocate it. Other languages like Ada and FORTRAN provide some memory management but may not prevent memory leaks. Many organizations, including those in the public sector, have applications that have been developed using languages that are memory unsafe and are often looking to modernize these to a memory safe language, such as Java, Python, JavaScript, or Golang.</p>

<p>The post 12 Months of Fighting Cybercrime &amp; Defending Enterprises | SentinelLABS 2024 Review appeared first on SentinelOne.</p>
<p>From the convergence of cybercrime and nation-state espionage to the strategic misuse of trusted platforms like Microsoft Azure and SaaS APIs, the cybersecurity landscape has grown more complex than ever in 2024. SentinelLABS has been at the forefront of these challenges, analyzing trends, uncovering campaigns, and equipping organizations with actionable intelligence.</p>

		<p>In the early days of computing, applications handled tasks sequentially. As the scale grew with millions of users, this approach became impractical. Asynchronous processing allowed handling multiple tasks concurrently, but managing threads/processes on a single machine led to resource constraints and complexity.</p>
<p>This is where distributed parallel processing comes in. By spreading the workload across multiple machines, each dedicated to a portion of the task, it offers a scalable and efficient solution. If you have a function to process a large batch of files, you can divide the workload across multiple machines to process files concurrently instead of handling them sequentially on one machine. Additionally, it improves performance by leveraging combined resources and provides scalability and fault tolerance. As the demands increase, you can add more machines to increase available resources.</p>

		<p><em>This post (originally published in 2019) has been updated to include recent product updates and cost calculations.</em></p>
<p>Many companies are moving to Kubernetes as the platform of choice for running software workloads. When an organization using VMs in AWS earlier decides to move to Kubernetes (Either EKS or self-managed in AWS), one of the questions that come up is whether one should continue to use Amazon CloudWatch or switch to some other tool like Prometheus? Many organizations think managing Prometheus can be challenging and bring more overheads. Recently, AWS launched a managed Prometheus service for such organizations. While CloudWatch vs Prometheus is not an exact apple to apple comparison, there are reasons to explore this and choose tooling that is built for the future. This post will explore various aspects and pros and cons, including costs of all three options.</p>

		<p>In the training phase, a machine learning (ML) model recognizes patterns in the training data and stores these patterns as numerical values called weights (model parameters). These parameters are used to predict an answer when the model is given new input data or a question.</p>
<p>For example, when you ask a question to ChatGPT or any other Large Language Model (LLM), it generates the answer for you. Other ML models are used to detect fraud transactions, image or even audio classification, and so on. These are examples of inference, where the ML model generates or predicts the answer based on the training data. For the inference to run, we need inference servers!</p>

		<p>While everyone is talking about new models and their possible use cases, their deployment aspect often gets overlooked. The journey from a trained model to a production-ready service is a complex and nuanced process that deserves more attention. From the perspective of a web API server, when a developer needs to access information like user profiles or services, we typically create a REST API service that interacts with the database. This API service also handles business logic, enabling the system to process and serve thousands of requests per minute efficiently. However, it is different when we talk about serving models.</p>
