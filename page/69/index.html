		<p>These console games all deserve remastering for the PC</p>
<p>While console and PC gaming have evolved side by side for decades, some big franchises have not made the transition to the other platform. That&rsquo;s especially true for the early years of the console wars, and while you could emulate those classic consoles and play the games in their original state, I&rsquo;m all for these classics getting the remaster or reboot treatment so they can come to the PC with the benefits of new graphics technology.</p>

	<div>
		<p>OLED monitors are excellent, but they&rsquo;re far from perfect</p>
<p>OLED monitors have become very popular in the last couple of years, especially among gamers, due to all the advantages they offer over traditional LCD panels. I&rsquo;ve owned multiple OLED monitors since 2022, with the Alienware AW3423DW being my very first one. As much as I enjoyed using them, these monitors aren&rsquo;t flawless.</p>

<p>As you expand your self-hosted services and home lab with new and varied projects, managing things like uptime and storage space can quickly become a pain. SSHing into individual servers or apps can be a pain, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to have a centralized dashboard where you could see, at a glance, the health of your home lab and its services?</p>

<p>The post 5 tips for promoting your open source project appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>After months or years of hard work, you’ve just pushed your open source project to GitHub and made it public. Now it’s time to tell the world about it.</p>
<p>Chances are you’d rather spend time writing code than getting the word out about your project. Maybe your project will go viral and you won’t have to spend much time on marketing. But chances are you’re going to need to do some work to build awareness, at least in the early days. Fortunately, there are plenty of people who have been down this path and are willing to help. In this article, experienced maintainers offer their advice on sharing open source projects with the world.</p>

		<p>Notion has over 120 integrations with other platforms and apps. But how many do you actually use?</p>
<p>Notion is a powerful all-in-one workspace, boasting over 120 integrations with other platforms and apps. But how many do you actually use? By connecting Notion with other tools, users can expand what’s possible and fill some of the gaps where Notion lacks in functionality. Unfortunately, Notion’s Integration Gallery doesn’t offer much value unless you’re using specific niche platforms. However, there are some meaningful options for everyday users.</p>

		<p>Tired of building NAS, retro gaming systems, and Pi-hole projects with your Raspberry Pi? Here are some useful, lesser-known alternatives</p>
<p>Thanks to its huge community of talented tinkerers and avant-garde coders, the Raspberry Pi ecosystem is brimming with useful projects. That said, popular projects like Raspberry Pi NAS, Pi-VPN, and even retro gaming setups can start to feel stale if you’ve been active in the DIY landscape. So, I’ve put together a list of unconventional projects you can build with your tiny tinkering machine.</p>

<p>We may have found the killer app for AI. Well, actually, British telecom provider O2 has. As The Guardian reports, they have an AI chatbot that acts like a 78-year-old grandmother and receives phone calls. Of course, since the grandmother—Daisy, by name—doesn’t get any real phone calls, anyone calling that number is probably a scammer. Daisy’s specialty? Keeping them tied up on the phone.</p>
<p>While this might just seem like a prank for revenge, it is actually more than that. Scamming people is a numbers game. Most people won’t bite. So, to be successful, scammers have to make lots of calls. Daisy can keep one tied up for around 40 minutes or more.</p>
