<p>Previously, Trustwave SpiderLabs covered a massive fake order spam scheme that impersonated a tech support company and propagated via Google Groups. Since then, we have observed more spam campaigns using this hybrid form of cyberattack with varying tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Between July and September, we witnessed a 140% increase in these spam campaigns. In this blog, we will showcase the different spam techniques used in these phishing emails.</p>

		<p>Create your own custom router with an old PC.</p>
<p>OPNsense will run on just about anything, including a low-power Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC). I have an old Minisforum NucBox 2 collecting dust and decided to throw OPNsense on the system to act as a testbench of sorts for loading up plugins, configuring various parts of the firewall OS, and testing deployments before applying changes to my primary OPNsense device, which was a purchase specifically for running as a router.</p>

<p>Ever hear one of those stories where as it unravels, you lean in ever closer and mutter “No way! <em>No way! NO WAY!</em>” This one, as far as infosec stories go, had me leaning and muttering like never before. Here goes:</p>
<p>Last week, someone reached out to me with what they claimed was a Spoutible data breach obtained by exploiting an enumerable API. Just your classic case of putting someone else&rsquo;s username in the URL and getting back data about them, which at first glance I assumed was another scraping situation like we recently saw with Trello. They sent me a file with 207k scraped records and a URL that looked like this:</p>

	<div>
		<p>How to use BitLocker to encrypt your external drives</p>
<p>Windows 11, Windows 10, and even older versions come pre-installed with a security and encryption feature called BitLocker. It enables users to encrypt everything on the drive where Windows is installed, protecting that data from theft or unauthorized access. If you haven’t heard of it, that’s because the feature isn’t available on every Windows PC. It is only available on the Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.</p>
