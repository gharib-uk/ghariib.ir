		<p>As the year comes to a close, NIST continues to engage with our international partners to strengthen cybersecurity, including sharing over ten new international translations in over six languages as resources for our stakeholders around the world.

		<p>The OneLogin hack is blowing up now it seems like whoever got access can also decrypt encrypted customer data which is just about AS BAD as it can get for a password/identity management service.

		<p>Have you ever built a piece of IKEA furniture, or put together a LEGO set, by following the instructions closely and only at the end realized at some point you didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> follow them correctly? The final result might be close to what was intended, but there&rsquo;s a nagging thought that maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;s not as rock steady or functional as it could have been.</p>
<p>Internet protocol specifications are instructions designed for engineers to build things. Protocol designers take great care to ensure the documents they produce are clear. The standardization process gathers consensus and review from experts in the field, to further ensure document quality. Any reasonably skilled engineer should be able to take a specification and produce a performant, reliable, and secure implementation. The Internet is central to everyone&rsquo;s lives, and we depend on these implementations. Any deviations from the specification can put us at risk. For example, mishandling of malformed requests can allow attacks such as request smuggling.</p>

<p>OpenShot, the free open-source beginner friendly video editor, released new 3.3 version yesterday with exciting new features!</p>
<p>This is a new major release that includes many new exciting features. First, the release uses <strong>new default “Cosmic Dusk” theme</strong> that works great for the dark style desktop environment.</p>
<p>The new theme is more compact than the previous ‘Humanity: Dark’ (which is still available for choice) that has better support for small displays.</p>

A new version of OpenShot video editor is out (a video editor which doesn’t have the best reputation for stability hence the nickname OpenShut). OpenShot—more accurately, ChatGPT or similar—says “OpenShot 3.3 is here to transform your editing experience! This release is as powerful as it is beautiful […] Take your video editing to the next level with OpenShot 3.3. Download it now and see the difference”. The headline change in OpenShot 3.3 is the use of a new default theme called Cosmic Dust. This apparently offers a “modern editing experience”. The new theme looks nice, it I’m not sure it […]</p>
