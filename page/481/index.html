		<p>As we close out the year, we&rsquo;re rounding up the articles that resonated the most with our readers on Linux, Kubernetes and OpenShift, Ansible automation, programming languages and runtimes, and more. </p>
<p>Love it or hate it, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to gain momentum across industries in 2024. This enthusiasm was reflected on the blog this year, with a focus on building technical skills for learning and working with AI.</p>
<p>This year brought many enhancements to the Red Hat OpenShift AI platform for building AI-enabled applications as well as other new AI solutions. At Red Hat Summit, we announced Podman AI Lab, an extension for Podman Desktop that lets you build, test, and run generative AI-powered applications within containers on a local environment. And in September, there was the general availability release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI, a foundation model platform that makes it easy for users with little to no data science expertise to experiment with large language models. </p>

		<p>2025 is fast approaching, but we have just enough time left to take a look at 2024&rsquo;s most popular articles on application development, as well as some standout learning paths and e-books.</p>
<h2 id="the-top-10-most-popular-app-dev-articles-of-2024">The top 10 most popular app dev articles of 2024</h2>
<p>This year&rsquo;s most popular topics include Kafka data storage and migration, API management, simplifying software security and identity access management. Solutions like Red Hat Developer Hub also garnered a lot of attention as engineering teams continue to seek ways to eliminate friction in the development process.</p>

	<div>
		<p>It can&rsquo;t be almost January yet. As the new year approaches, it&rsquo;s time to reflect on the top learning paths Red Hat Developer published this year, along with highlighting key paths that were too new to make the list.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of developer you are, it can be difficult enough to keep up with the technologies you already work with. Learning new areas, tools, and products can be daunting on top of managing heavy workloads, so structured self-service developer learning has come to the forefront as an important option for skilling up and learning new things. That explains the strong success of our beginner content, as you will see.</p>
