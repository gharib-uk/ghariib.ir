		<p>It is required to have a stable  application binary interface (ABI) when maintaining a stable shared library that is written in C or C++ and shipped as part of a complex software stack. Developers must comply with this requirement. When building a newer version of a shared library, developers may try the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the ABI changes.</li>
<li>Detect the potential incompatibility of the changes, or ABI breaks.</li>
<li>Fix them before releasing the library.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform the analysis, developers can use the abidiff tool to compare the newer version of the shared library against the previous stable version. The abidiff tool is part of the libabigail framework. It reports the ABI changes to data types and how they impact the functions of variables.</p>

		<p>Simple tips for fighting spam email.</p>
<p><em>“Hello, this is your distant relative from Nigeria. I’m writing because I have a terminal illness and no other living relatives. My dying wish is to transfer my inheritance of $100 million to you while I still can…”</em> — we’ve all probably received an email like this at some point during our online existence. Originally known as “Nigerian prince” scams, today they bear the label “419” (after the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud). These days, however, instead of a “Nigerian prince”, you’re more likely to receive a letter from a fake employee of a bank, online store, or delivery service — or even… the President of the United States.</p>

<p>This is a beginner’s guide shows how to enable the experimental HDR feature in Ubuntu, Fedora Workstation, and other Linux with recent GNOME.</p>
<p>HDR is a technology allowing to transmit high dynamic range videos and images to compatible displays. KDE has HDR support in Plasma 6, and GNOME is going to add HDR toggle option in next v48 release.</p>

<p>The rise of AI-driven cyber threats has introduced a new level of sophistication to phishing scams, particularly those targeting Gmail users.</p>
<p>Criminals are using artificial intelligence to create eerily realistic impersonations of Google support representatives, Forbes recently reported. These scams don’t just rely on misleading emails; they also include convincing phone calls that appear to come from legitimate sources.</p>
<p><strong>If you receive a call claiming to be from Google support, just hang up</strong>—this could be an AI-driven scam designed to trick you into handing over your Gmail credentials.</p>

		<p><em>Trigger warning: incredibly wonky theoretical cryptography post (written by a non-theorist)!</em> <em>Also, this will be in two parts. I plan to be back with some more thoughts on practical stuff, like cloud backup, in the near future.</em></p>
<p>If you’ve read my blog over the years, you should understand that I have basically two obsessions. One is my interest in building “practical” schemes that solve real problems that come up in the real world. The other is a weird fixation on the theoretical models that underpin (the security of) many of those same schemes. In particular, one of my favorite bugaboos is a particular model, or “heuristic”, called the random oracle model (ROM) — essentially a fancy way to think about hash functions.</p>

<p>There are times when you feel like you&rsquo;re drowning in a sea of information and struggling to connect the dots between ideas, projects, and those random sparks of inspiration. I tried various note-taking and productivity apps, but they did not meet my needs for creating a visual knowledge base. I was starting to think that a good old-fashioned notebook and some highlighters were the best way to keep my thoughts organized. Then I discovered Noteey.</p>

	<div>
		<p>In part 1 of this blog series, we walked through the risks associated with using sensitive data as part of your generative AI application. This overview provided a baseline of the challenges of using sensitive data with a non-deterministic large language model (LLM) and how to mitigate these challenges with Amazon Bedrock Agents. The next question that might come to mind is where and how to use sensitive data across LLM training, fine-tuning, vector databases, agents, and tooling. In this blog post, we build on part 1 with a more detailed discussion about data governance. Then, knowing the data governance baseline, we walk through how to use sensitive data across different data sources with the correct data authorization model. Lastly, we talk about how to implement data authorization mechanisms as part of a generative AI application that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as part of the architecture.</p>
