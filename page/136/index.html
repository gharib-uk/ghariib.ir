<p>Data Privacy Week is here, and there’s no better time to shine a spotlight on one of the biggest players in the personal information economy: data brokers. These entities collect, buy, and sell hundreds—sometimes thousands—of data points on individuals like you. But how do they manage to gather so much information, and for what purpose? From your browsing habits and purchase history to your location data and even more intimate details, these digital middlemen piece together surprisingly comprehensive profiles. The real question is: where are they getting it all, and why is your personal data so valuable to them? Let’s unravel the mystery behind the data broker industry.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-devops-a-modern-approach-to-software-development">Introduction to DevOps: A Modern Approach to Software Development</h2>
<p>DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and productivity between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The goal of DevOps is to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. By emphasizing automation, collaboration, and monitoring, DevOps ensures that applications can be developed, tested, and deployed faster, more reliably, and with greater stability.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Building software is hard enough without getting bogged down by repetitive tasks, endless approval chains, and inconsistent tooling. Enter golden paths—the shortcuts every developer wishes they had. They’re not just about speed. They’re about freeing your brain to focus on the good stuff: writing code, solving problems, and shipping features.</p>
<p>This guide explores how golden paths and software templates can transform your workflow from chaos to cosmos. We’ll cover how to set them up, why they matter, and where they might trip you up. By the end, you’ll have a clear map to hyperspace your way to faster, more secure, and less frustrating development.</p>

		<p><strong>Open-source technology</strong> has significantly shaped how industries approach complex technical challenges and foster innovation. It has expanded beyond software to impact hardware and systems design, opening up new pathways for researchers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts to develop advanced solutions. This collective approach fuels innovation and contributes to sustainable development by creating accessible, adaptable tools that solve real-world problems at scale.</p>

<p>Open-source technology fundamentally changes how we access and utilise high-tech tools. Traditionally, advanced instruments like oscilloscopes, signal generators, and spectrum analysers were accessible primarily to well-funded research labs. With open-source tools such as Red Pitaya’s “pocket lab,” engineers and students can now access powerful measurement and testing capabilities in a compact, cost-effective format. This allows universities, startups, and even independent researchers and enthusiasts to innovate without being restricted by cost or proprietary limitations.</p>

	<b><time>29.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When managing a database, it&rsquo;s often useful to identify which tables contain data. This can help with troubleshooting, maintenance, or simply understanding the database&rsquo;s structure and usage. Here’s how to check for tables with data across different relational database management systems (RDBMS).</p>
<h2 id="for-postgresql"><strong>For PostgreSQL</strong></h2>
<p>In PostgreSQL, you can dynamically generate a query to check row counts for all tables within a schema using <code>pg_catalog.pg_tables</code>:</p>
<h3 id="using-a-plpgsql-block">Using a PL/pgSQL Block:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DO $$
DECLARE
    tbl RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR tbl IN
        SELECT schemaname, tablename
        FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
        WHERE schemaname = &#39;public&#39;  -- Change schema if needed
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format(
            &#39;SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, &#39;&#39;%I&#39;&#39; AS table_name FROM %I.%I&#39;,
            tbl.tablename, tbl.schemaname, tbl.tablename
        );
    END LOOP;
END $$;
</code></pre><p>This script loops through all tables in the <code>public</code> schema and outputs the row count for each table.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Ansible execution environments provide a runtime for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform that includes all of the necessary tooling in a single atomic package. Ansible, as an automation tool, relies on Python as its underlying programming language. Not only is Python integral to the core of Ansible, but its use is widespread and can be found throughout the Ansible ecosystem, including Ansible execution environments. As a result, how Python content is managed directly impacts how an execution environment is constructed and operates at runtime. This article will explore the various ways that Python can be managed in Ansible execution environments, including considerations that apply to a variety of operating environments.</p>
