<p>Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-generation-tools-comparison">Different SBOM generation tools comparison</h2>
<p>If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization.</p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>At MWC 2023 Barcelona, <strong>Google Cloud</strong> announced that they can now run the <strong>radio access network (RAN)</strong> functions as software on Google Distributed Cloud Edge, providing communications service providers (CSPs- AKA telcos) with a common and agile operating model that extends from the core of the network to the edge, for a high degree of programmability, flexibility, and low operating expenses.  CSPs have already embraced open architecture, open-source software, disaggregation, automation, cloud, AI and machine learning, and new operational models, to name a few. The journey started in the last decade with Network Functions Virtualization, primarily with value added services and then deeper with core network applications, and in the past few years, that evolved into a push towards cloud-native. With significant progress in the core, the time for <strong>Cloud RAN</strong> is now, according to Google.  However, whether for industry or region-specific compliance reasons, data sovereignty needs, or latency or local data-processing requirements, most of the network functions deployed in a mobile or wireline network may have to follow a hybrid deployment model where network functions are placed flexibly in a combination of both on-premises and cloud regions. RAN, which is traditionally implemented with proprietary hardware, falls into that camp as well.</p>

<p>In 2025, <strong>cloud native security</strong> is set to undergo transformative progress. As Chief Information Security Officer at Aqua, I’ve seen how rapidly evolving threats and operational demands are driving organizations to redefine their approach to security. The focus is no longer just on adapting to challenges—it’s about deeply embedding security into every facet of development pipelines, runtime environments, and cloud ecosystems. </p>

	<b><time>03.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>For the last couple of years, a lot of attention has been placed on the evolutionary state of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on cybersecurity. In many industries, the risks associated with AI-generated attacks are still present and concerning, especially with the global average of data breach costs increasing by 10% from last year.</p>
<p>However, according to the most recent Cloud Threat Landscape Report released by IBM’s X-Force team, the near-term threat of an AI-generated attack targeting cloud computing environments is actually moderately low. Still, projections from X-Force reveal that an increase in these sophisticated attack methods could be on the horizon.</p>
