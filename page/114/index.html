		<p>In this article, you’ll learn about the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) tool and how we take advantage of it to implement system and application monitoring for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.What is Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)PCP is an open source performance monitoring and analysis framework developed by Red Hat. It provides a suite of tools, libraries and services to monitor, retrieve and analyze performance metrics from different systems, services and applications. PCP is designed for scalability, enabling it to monitor anything from a single server to a large, distributed network of machi</p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in SimpleHelp RMM that could allow for arbitrary code execution. SimpleHelp is a popular remote access software. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities when chained together could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>As internet security evolves, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates, cornerstones of encrypted communication, are stepping into a brand-new role as vital tools in the fight against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Experts are now leveraging <strong>SSL intelligence</strong> and historical SSL data to expose hidden threat actor infrastructure, track malware activity, and thwart potential cyber threats before they gain traction.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Austrian economist Gene Callahan likes to remind us that fantasy is not an adult policy option.</p>
<p>We are often reminded of his words in national debates and handwringing over potential budget cuts, whether by the Republican-led Congress, or President Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—or attempts to address the $36 trillion debt elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Economist Bryan Caplan has pointed out a number of systematically biased beliefs American voters hold about the economy. Generally, Americans tend to hold four basic biases about the economy: an anti-market bias, leading to favor government intervention; an anti-foreign bias, which leads them to underestimate the contributions of foreigners and the benefits of trade; a make-work bias, which equates prosperity with the number of jobs (regardless of productivity or value added); and a pessimism bias, which leads them to think that economic conditions are far worse than they really are.</p>
