	<b><time>07.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When Southwest Airlines’ crew scheduling system became overwhelmed during the 2022 holiday season, the company faced what would become a $800 million operational meltdown. CIO Lauren Woods and her technology team hadn’t caused the crisis, but they would need to solve it. </p>
<p>“I liken it to being like a designated driver at a party,” Woods reflects. “You didn’t bring the Wild Turkey, but all of a sudden you’re responsible for getting everybody home safe.”</p>

<p>Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a class of material that’s been receiving significant attention as a possible successor of silicon. Recently, a team of researchers has demonstrated the use of TMDs as an alternative to through-silicon-vias (TSV), which is the current way that multiple layers of silicon semiconductor circuitry are stacked, as seen with, e.g., NAND Flash ICs and processors with stacked memory dice. The novelty here is that the new circuitry is grown directly on top of the existing circuitry, removing the need for approaches like TSV to turn 2D layers into 3D stacks.</p>

		<p>You’ve been there before: standing in front of your team, announcing a major technological transformation that you know is crucial for the company’s future. Despite your careful preparation, you can see it in their eyes—skepticism, confusion, or worse, quiet resignation. The change you’re proposing may be exactly what the organization needs, but your message isn’t quite landing the way you hoped.</p>
<p>This scenario plays out in enterprise technology organizations every day, and it’s exactly what Paul Gaffney, former technology executive at Home Depot and Dick’s Sporting Goods, addressed in his powerful talk at the Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit 2024. After decades of driving major technological transformations, Gaffney has discovered that the difference between a change initiative’s success and failure often comes down to one critical skill: the ability to communicate in a way that truly enlists people in your vision.</p>

		<p>Such a flaw stems from Nuclei&rsquo;s template signature verification process, with the simultaneous usage of regular expressions, or regex, and YAML parser potentially resulting in the introduction of a &ldquo;r&rdquo; character read as a line break and leading to the circumvention of regex-based signature verification.</p>
