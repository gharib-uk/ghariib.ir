		<p>How cyberhooligans are hacking vulnerable Ecovacs robot vacuums and lawnmowers to spy on their owners and rain misery upon them.</p>
<p>Imagine: you get up in the night for a glass of water, walk across the unlit landing, when out of the darkness a voice starts yelling at you. Not nice, you’d surely agree. But that’s the new reality for owners of vulnerable robot vacuums, which can be commanded by hackers to turn from domestic servants into foul-mouthed louts. And that’s not all: hackers can also control the robot remotely and access its live camera feed.</p>

		<p>Our latest Canonical website rebrand did not just bring the new Vanilla-based frontend, it also saw the introduction of Python Flask as the preferred web framework. Flask provides a good foundation for building new applications using the 12-factor methodology, effectively increasing our web team’s speed and efficiency in adding new features.</p>
<p>Because our web team works on both the website and the product’s UI we decided to take operational improvements one step further by providing a way to stand up in a few simple commands a fully integrated and observable Kubernetes environment for their Flask apps. Our solution, called 12-factor charms, provides an easy to use abstraction layer over existing Canonical products and it is aimed at application developers who create applications based on the 12-factor methodology.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Event-Driven Ansible is a powerful extension to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform that leverages the automation infrastructure to provide the ability to react to change or problems. In short, Event-Driven Ansible can trigger Ansible playbooks (or Ansible Automation Platform&rsquo;s Job Templates) if a certain event is detected.</p>
<p>In this article, we will provide a series of examples on how to use Event-Driven Ansible to implement several remediation strategies based on activities in the environment. We&rsquo;ll use Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP), part of Red Hat Runtimes, as a reference implementation.</p>

<p>At the recent 38C3 conference in Germany, someone gave a talk about sending TOSLINK digital audio over fiber optic networks rather than the very low-end short distance fibre you’ll find behind hour CD player. This gave [Manawyrm] some ideas, so of course the IP-over TOSLINK network was born.</p>
<p>TOSLINK is in effect I2S digital audio as light, so it carries two 44.1 kilosamples per second 16-bit data streams over a synchronous serial connection. At 1544 Kbps, this is coincidentally about the same as a T1 leased line. The synchronous serial link of a TOSLINK connection is close enough to the High-Level Data Link Control, or HDLC, protocol used in some networking applications, and as luck would have it she had some experience in using PPP over HDLC. She could configure her software from that to use a pair of cheap USB sound cards with TOSLINK ports, and achieve a surprisingly respectable 1.47 Mbit/s.</p>

		<p>Ivanti released security updates to address vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-0282, CVE-2025-0283) in Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways. A cyber threat actor could exploit CVE-2025-0282 to take control of an affected system.</p>
<p>CISA has added CVE-2025-0282 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.</p>
<p>CISA urges organizations to hunt for any malicious activity, report any positive findings to CISA, and review the following for more information:</p>

		<p>Martin Wendiggensen reveals how disinformation shaped Taiwan’s election, and how AI-powered research uncovered hidden influences on voter behavior. </p>
<p>AI disinformation, deep fakes, armies of lying bots, and automated deception is the biggest threat to our elections, or so we’ve been told. But looking at Taiwan’s 2024 election, none of these nightmare scenarios materialized. The deafening silence of effective AI disinformation from China, America’s most advanced opponent, was surprising. Even more so given the focus on the election at the highest levels of the Chinese government.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Long Paper: All-You-Can-Compute: Packed Secret Sharing for Combined Resilience</strong><br>
<em>Sebastian Faust, Maximilian Orlt, Kathrin Wirschem, Liang Zhao</em></p>
<p>Unprotected cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to implementation attacks, such as passive side-channel attacks and active fault injection attacks. Recently, countermeasures like polynomial masking and duplicated masking have been introduced to protect implementations against combined attacks that exploit leakage and faults simultaneously. While duplicated masking requires $O(t * e)$ shares to resist an adversary capable of probing $t$ values and faulting $e$ values, polynomial masking requires only $O(t + e)$ shares, which is particularly beneficial for affine computation. At CHES&rsquo;$24$, Arnold et al. showed how to further improve the efficiency of polynomial masking in the presence of combined attacks by embedding two secrets into one polynomial sharing. This essentially reduces the complexity of previous constructions by half. The authors also observed that using techniques from packed secret sharing (Grosso et al., CHES&rsquo;$13$) cannot easily achieve combined resilience to encode an arbitrary number of secrets in one polynomial encoding. In this work, we resolve these challenges and show that it is possible to embed an arbitrary number of secrets in one encoding and propose gadgets that are secure against combined attacks. We present two constructions that are generic and significantly improve the computational and randomness complexity of existing compilers, such as the laOla compiler presented by Berndt et al. at CRYPTO&rsquo;$23$ and its improvement by Arnold et al. For example, for an AES evaluation that protects against $t$ probes and $e$ faults, we improve the randomness complexity of the state-of-the-art construction when $t+e&gt;3$, leading to an improvement of up to a factor of $2.41$.</p>

		<p>For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest a total of 4 head units have been selected. One of these is the single DIN Sony XAV-AX8500 that offers a variety of functionality such as wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as well as USB media playback and more.</p>
<p>This blog post presents internal photos of the XAV-AX8500 boards and highlights each of the interesting components.</p>
<p><strong>Internals</strong></p>
<p>Accessing the internals of the XAV-AX8500 involves removing a few screws and metal plates. Once the main chassis is open 3 interconnected boards are exposed that are connected via flat flexible cables. The main board is shown below.</p>

		<p>Docker has become an essential tool for developers in today’s tech-driven world. Initially used by a limited number of companies, primarily in the product-based space, Docker is now widely adopted by startups, mid-sized companies, MNCs, and freelancers alike. Its numerous benefits include increased team productivity and reduced system errors. Moreover, Docker-related questions are frequently asked in job interviews, making it a must-have skill for developers aiming for better salaries and career growth.</p>
