		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Ideal Compartmented Secret Sharing Scheme Based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem for Polynomial Rings</strong><br>
<em>Alexandru-Valentin Basaga, Sorin Iftene</em></p>
<p>A secret sharing scheme starts with a secret and then derives from it certain shares (or shadows) which are distributed to users. The secret may be recovered only by certain predetermined groups. In case of compartmented secret sharing, the set of users is partitioned into compartments and the secret can be recovered only if the number of participants from any compartment is greater than or equal to a fixed compartment threshold and the total number of participants is greater than or equal to a global threshold.</p>

		<p>Interesting research: “How to Securely Implement Cryptography in Deep Neural Networks.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose “bits” are arbitrary real numbers&hellip;</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Within the Cloudflare Application Security team, every machine learning model we use is underpinned by a rich set of static rules that serve as a ground truth and a baseline comparison for how our models are performing. These are called heuristics. Our Bot Management heuristics engine has served as an important part of eight global machine learning (ML) models, but we needed a more expressive engine to increase our accuracy. In this post, we’ll review how we solved this by moving our heuristics to the Cloudflare Ruleset Engine. Not only did this provide the platform we needed to write more nuanced rules, it made our platform simpler and safer, and provided Bot Management customers more flexibility and visibility into their bot traffic.   </p>

		<p>Deploying FreePBX and Asterisk on a single Ubuntu virtual machine in a public cloud is an ideal solution for personal users and small to medium-sized businesses with voice over IP (VoIP) and fax over IP (FoIP) needs. This setup costs nothing, is scalable and secure, and has daily recovery points with a recovery time measured in minutes. In this article and its <strong>companion how-to guide on GitHub</strong>, you’ll go through the Day 0 to Day 2 process of provisioning a long-running FreePBX system that is reliable, easy to maintain, and optimized for both voice and fax communications.</p>

<p>Nearly every organization runs in the cloud, driven by promised outcomes, like 65% faster product and service delivery. AI has only accelerated cloud investment, with 63% of top-performing companies citing AI for their decision.</p>
<p>But the cloud comes with risks. Up to 80% of security exposures occur in the cloud, compounded by a recent 66% surge in attacks and the reality that cloud-native risks shift regularly.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I’m excited to share my new open-source project, <strong>EasyREST</strong>. If you’ve ever worked with PostgREST for simple CRUD operations and thought, “I wish I could easily switch between SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and more,” then this project is for you!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-easyrest">What Is EasyREST?</h2>
<p>EasyREST is a lightweight and secure REST API server that gives you one unified interface for virtually any relational database. Instead of writing separate API layers for each database, EasyREST lets you connect to multiple databases through a single API with built-in support for authentication and context-aware queries.</p>
