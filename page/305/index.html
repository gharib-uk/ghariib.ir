		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Long Paper: All-You-Can-Compute: Packed Secret Sharing for Combined Resilience</strong><br>
<em>Sebastian Faust, Maximilian Orlt, Kathrin Wirschem, Liang Zhao</em></p>
<p>Unprotected cryptographic implementations are vulnerable to implementation attacks, such as passive side-channel attacks and active fault injection attacks. Recently, countermeasures like polynomial masking and duplicated masking have been introduced to protect implementations against combined attacks that exploit leakage and faults simultaneously. While duplicated masking requires $O(t * e)$ shares to resist an adversary capable of probing $t$ values and faulting $e$ values, polynomial masking requires only $O(t + e)$ shares, which is particularly beneficial for affine computation. At CHES&rsquo;$24$, Arnold et al. showed how to further improve the efficiency of polynomial masking in the presence of combined attacks by embedding two secrets into one polynomial sharing. This essentially reduces the complexity of previous constructions by half. The authors also observed that using techniques from packed secret sharing (Grosso et al., CHES&rsquo;$13$) cannot easily achieve combined resilience to encode an arbitrary number of secrets in one polynomial encoding. In this work, we resolve these challenges and show that it is possible to embed an arbitrary number of secrets in one encoding and propose gadgets that are secure against combined attacks. We present two constructions that are generic and significantly improve the computational and randomness complexity of existing compilers, such as the laOla compiler presented by Berndt et al. at CRYPTO&rsquo;$23$ and its improvement by Arnold et al. For example, for an AES evaluation that protects against $t$ probes and $e$ faults, we improve the randomness complexity of the state-of-the-art construction when $t+e&gt;3$, leading to an improvement of up to a factor of $2.41$.</p>

		<p>For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest a total of 4 head units have been selected. One of these is the single DIN Sony XAV-AX8500 that offers a variety of functionality such as wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as well as USB media playback and more.</p>
<p>This blog post presents internal photos of the XAV-AX8500 boards and highlights each of the interesting components.</p>
<p><strong>Internals</strong></p>
<p>Accessing the internals of the XAV-AX8500 involves removing a few screws and metal plates. Once the main chassis is open 3 interconnected boards are exposed that are connected via flat flexible cables. The main board is shown below.</p>

		<p>Docker has become an essential tool for developers in today’s tech-driven world. Initially used by a limited number of companies, primarily in the product-based space, Docker is now widely adopted by startups, mid-sized companies, MNCs, and freelancers alike. Its numerous benefits include increased team productivity and reduced system errors. Moreover, Docker-related questions are frequently asked in job interviews, making it a must-have skill for developers aiming for better salaries and career growth.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ivanti Products, the most severe of which could allow for remote code execution. Ivanti Endpoint Manager is a client-based unified endpoint management software. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ivanti Connect Secure is an SSL VPN solution for remote and mobile users.</li>
<li>Ivanti Policy Secure (IPS) is a network access control (NAC) solution which provides network access only to authorized and secured users and devices.</li>
<li>Ivanti Neurons for Zero Trust Access (ZTA) Gateways securely connects devices to web applications, whether on-premises or in the cloud, using Zero Trust principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
