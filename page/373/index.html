		<p>While external cyberattacks often make the headlines, internal security risks (aka insider risks) present a significant danger that is sometimes underestimated. These risks can arise from disgruntled employees, negligent insiders, or malicious actors with privileged access. The repercussions of such breaches can be severe, resulting in data loss, financial harm, legal fines, and harm to reputation.</p>
<p>Effectively managing internal security threats requires a careful and balanced approach. Implementing overly strict measures can hinder creativity and dampen current employee morale, yet having weak security protocols can leave organizations open to exploitation. This article delves into the various facets of internal threats, exploring the potential outcomes and examining the essential elements of a strong internal security plan.</p>

<p>There are already many backend libraries and frameworks for Node.js on the market. I&rsquo;ve used Nest.js for some small projects before. It has comprehensive functions and enables rapid project implementation. However, for my small projects, many of its features are really overkill, and it has a high level of encapsulation, leaving little freedom when writing code.</p>
<p>By chance, I came across Hono online. After reading its documentation:</p>

		<p>Security leaders continue to be under intense pressure. Increasingly, they are turning toward third parties for support and expertise as their cybersecurity woes become more dire and it becomes harder to recruit and retain talent.  This is reflected in the projected growth for cybersecurity services through 20281 (managed security services, managed detection and response, security consulting, and security professional services).</p>
<p>According to Gartner1, end-user spending for all security services will grow from $77.4 billion in 2024 to $116.9 billion in 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 percent. Managed detection and response (MDR) is forecasted to be the highest growth area of security services, with a projected 17.1 percent CAGR through 2028. This is in part due to the continued, acute need for support with threat monitoring, detection, and response. However, it’s also due to a growing need for help with risk identification, management and governance, exposure and vulnerability management, and incident readiness due to increasingly stringent requirements by regulators for reporting in these areas.</p>
