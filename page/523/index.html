<p>It’s a new year, and I’ve decided it’s a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal.</p>
<p>I have now been working on Signal for almost a decade. It has always been my goal for Signal to grow and sustain beyond my involvement, but four years ago that would still not have been possible. I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone. I couldn’t ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation.</p>

<p>Signal released <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/">end-to-end encrypted group calls</a> a year ago, and since then we’ve scaled from support for 5 participants all the way to 40. There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open source <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Calling-Service">Signal Calling Service</a> to do the job. This post will describe how it works in more detail.</p>

<p>Signal has no data to sell, no advertisers to sell it to, and no shareholders to benefit from such a sale. We’re building a different kind of tech – where your data stays in your hands – but we’re also building a different kind of tech <em>organization</em>. One without investors, quarterly earnings calls, or share price considerations. While the model for conventional tech companies incentivizes them to build products for <em>your data</em> rather than for <em>you</em>, Signal’s nonprofit structure is designed so that the only way value can accrue is in the experience of using the app; the only place it can accrue is in the hands of the people who use it.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of unsolicited and unwanted messaging dates back to the earliest communication platforms: from <a href="https://www.livescience.com/7028-ancient-cave-art-full-teenage-graffiti.html">prehistoric cave graffiti</a> and postal chain letters to popup ads and robocalls. To prevent spam, most online services rely on large-scale inspection of plaintext conversation content or detailed social-graph analysis to determine who is saying what to whom and whether or not that should be allowed. At Signal, we build on a foundation of privacy and do not have access to that type of data or metadata.</p>
