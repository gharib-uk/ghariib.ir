		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>PSMT: Private Segmented Membership Test for Distributed Record Linkage</strong><br>
<em>Nirajan Koirala, Jonathan Takeshita, Jeremy Stevens, Sam Martin, Taeho Jung</em></p>
<p>In various real-world situations, a client may need to verify whether specific data elements they possess are part of a set segmented among numerous data holders. To maintain user privacy, it’s essential that both the client’s data elements and the data holders’ sets remain encrypted throughout the process. Existing approaches like Private Set Intersection (PSI), Multi-Party PSI (MPSI), Private Segmented Membership Test (PSMT), and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) face challenges in these contexts. They either require data holders to access the sets in plaintext, result in high latency when aggregating data from multiple holders, risk exposing the identity of the party with the matching element, cause a large communication overhead for multiple-element queries, or lead to high false positives.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>PunSearch: Enabling Puncturable Encrypted Search over Lattice for Cloud Storage Systems</strong><br>
<em>Yibo Cao, Shiyuan Xu, Gang Xu, Xiu-Bo Chen, Tao Shang, Yuling Chen, Zongpeng Li</em></p>
<p>Searchable encryption (SE) has been widely studied for cloud storage systems, allowing data encrypted search and retrieval. However, existing SE schemes can not support the fine-grained searchability revocation, making it impractical for real applications. Puncturable encryption (PE) [Oakland'15] can revoke the decryption ability of a data receiver for a specific message, which can potentially alleviate this issue. Moreover, the threat of quantum computing remains an important and realistic concern, potentially leading to data privacy leakage for cloud storage systems. Consequently, designing a post-quantum puncturable encrypted search scheme is still far-reaching. In this paper, we propose PunSearch, the first puncturable encrypted search scheme over lattice for outsourced data privacy-preserving in cloud storage systems. PunSearch provides a fine-grained searchability revocation while enjoying quantum safety. Different from existing PE schemes, we construct a novel trapdoor generation mechanism through evaluation algorithms and lattice pre-image sampling technique. We then design a search permission verification method to revoke the searchability for specific keywords. Furthermore, we formalize a new IND-Pun-CKA security model, and utilize it to analyze the security of PunSearch. Comprehensive performance evaluation indicates that the computational overheads of Encrypt, Trapdoor, Search, and Puncture algorithms in PunSearch are just 0.06, 0.005, 0.05, and 0.31 times of other prior arts, respectively under the best cases. These results demonstrate that PunSearch is effective and secure for cloud storage systems.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ransomware">What is Ransomware?</h2>
<p>Ransomware is a malicious application that locks a person’s data, which is impossible to access until they pay money. Cybercriminals get into systems through phishing emails, software weaknesses, or more sophisticated techniques such as session hijacking.</p>

<p>Ransomware is more of a threat in 2024 compared to the present. Such attacks are becoming more frequent, and so is their complexity. Moreover, the cost of such attacks is increasing. Here are some vital facts and insights about this looming threat:</p>

<p>Dumpster diving is one of those experiences that can net you some pretty cool gear for a reasonable price. Case in point the 24″ Samsung S24E650XW LCD monitor that [MisterHW] saved from being trashed. Apparently in very good condition with no visible external damage, the unit even powered up without issues. It seemed like a golden find until he got onto the Windows desktop and began to notice quaint red shimmering in darker areas and other issues that made it clear why the monitor had been tossed. Of course, the second best part about dumpster diving is seeing whether you can repair such issues.</p>
