	<b><time>23.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Neoliberalism is a myth. The concept suggests that starting in the 1970s Western economies have been shaped by free-market principles, the state has retreated, and markets have reigned supreme. And yet, the last fifty years were not about liberalizing, but about strengthening the state. Neoliberalism never happened. Instead, what unfolded was neostatism—a strategy where governments restructured their role to protect and expand their power. From the late 1970s onward, policies branded as “neoliberal” were crafted not to relinquish state control but to reassert it. And today, as overt state intervention returns with a vengeance, it becomes clear that the “neoliberal era” was a carefully managed illusion.</p>

		<p><em>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Predicting 2025.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, seeing the &lsquo;Stargate&rsquo; rollout in the US, it seems that AI is far from stepping off the stage. Instead, we can expect significant developments in the ongoing scenario.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence, fondly known as AI, was first coined in 1956. It has taken decades to reach where we are today, but the next phase or wave of advancements will likely take drastically less time. At this point, we’ve explored the possibilities of AI in nearly every field, and now is the time to start implementing them strategically. It’s like getting comfortable in a car and finally taking it for drifts—&ldquo;the real ride,&rdquo; if you will.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve pulled off something really impressive with this series of Founders Edition cards.</p>
<p>With the launch of NVIDIA&rsquo;s RTX 50 series GPUs, as is tradition, we were introduced to a brand-new design for their signature &ldquo;Founders Edition&rdquo; cards. While brands like ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI and others will release their own designs a little while after the official launch, NVIDIA always releases their own take on reigning in the horsepower of their latest creation first in the form of a reference card.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the second day of Pwn2Own Automotive 2025. Yesterday, we awarded more than $380,000 for 16 unique 0-days - and we had several bug collisions as well. Today looks to be even better, with the WOLFBOX and Tesla EV chargers making their Pwn2Own debut. Here’s how the Master of Pwn standings look at the beginning of Day Two:</p>
