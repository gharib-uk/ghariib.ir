		<p>Today, we&rsquo;re excited to invite you to beta-test Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10, the next major version of the enterprise operating system. With this newest release, we’re delivering a modern Linux experience on a platform that can support enduring operational technologies and emerging workloads alike.This beta strengthens a commitment we made when we released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 in 2019: to release a new major edition every three years and offer more lifecycle predictability for our customers. RHEL 10, due to reach general availability in mid-2025, will be our third major release</p>

		<p>Have you ever built a piece of IKEA furniture, or put together a LEGO set, by following the instructions closely and only at the end realized at some point you didn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> follow them correctly? The final result might be close to what was intended, but there&rsquo;s a nagging thought that maybe, just maybe, it&rsquo;s not as rock steady or functional as it could have been.</p>
<p>Internet protocol specifications are instructions designed for engineers to build things. Protocol designers take great care to ensure the documents they produce are clear. The standardization process gathers consensus and review from experts in the field, to further ensure document quality. Any reasonably skilled engineer should be able to take a specification and produce a performant, reliable, and secure implementation. The Internet is central to everyone&rsquo;s lives, and we depend on these implementations. Any deviations from the specification can put us at risk. For example, mishandling of malformed requests can allow attacks such as request smuggling.</p>

<p>OpenShot, the free open-source beginner friendly video editor, released new 3.3 version yesterday with exciting new features!</p>
<p>This is a new major release that includes many new exciting features. First, the release uses <strong>new default “Cosmic Dusk” theme</strong> that works great for the dark style desktop environment.</p>
<p>The new theme is more compact than the previous ‘Humanity: Dark’ (which is still available for choice) that has better support for small displays.</p>

A new version of OpenShot video editor is out (a video editor which doesn’t have the best reputation for stability hence the nickname OpenShut). OpenShot—more accurately, ChatGPT or similar—says “OpenShot 3.3 is here to transform your editing experience! This release is as powerful as it is beautiful […] Take your video editing to the next level with OpenShot 3.3. Download it now and see the difference”. The headline change in OpenShot 3.3 is the use of a new default theme called Cosmic Dust. This apparently offers a “modern editing experience”. The new theme looks nice, it I’m not sure it […]</p>

		<p>As we close out the year, we&rsquo;re rounding up the articles that resonated the most with our readers on Linux, Kubernetes and OpenShift, Ansible automation, programming languages and runtimes, and more. </p>
<p>Love it or hate it, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to gain momentum across industries in 2024. This enthusiasm was reflected on the blog this year, with a focus on building technical skills for learning and working with AI.</p>
<p>This year brought many enhancements to the Red Hat OpenShift AI platform for building AI-enabled applications as well as other new AI solutions. At Red Hat Summit, we announced Podman AI Lab, an extension for Podman Desktop that lets you build, test, and run generative AI-powered applications within containers on a local environment. And in September, there was the general availability release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI, a foundation model platform that makes it easy for users with little to no data science expertise to experiment with large language models. </p>

		<p>2025 is fast approaching, but we have just enough time left to take a look at 2024&rsquo;s most popular articles on application development, as well as some standout learning paths and e-books.</p>

<p>This year&rsquo;s most popular topics include Kafka data storage and migration, API management, simplifying software security and identity access management. Solutions like Red Hat Developer Hub also garnered a lot of attention as engineering teams continue to seek ways to eliminate friction in the development process.</p>

		<p>It can&rsquo;t be almost January yet. As the new year approaches, it&rsquo;s time to reflect on the top learning paths Red Hat Developer published this year, along with highlighting key paths that were too new to make the list.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of developer you are, it can be difficult enough to keep up with the technologies you already work with. Learning new areas, tools, and products can be daunting on top of managing heavy workloads, so structured self-service developer learning has come to the forefront as an important option for skilling up and learning new things. That explains the strong success of our beginner content, as you will see.</p>
