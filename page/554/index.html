<p>Traditionally, asynchronous messaging systems such as email have relied on protocols like PGP or S/MIME for cryptographic security. These protocols work the way most people are familiar with: one who wishes to receive encrypted email advertises a public key, and those wishing to send encrypted email to that person encrypt their outgoing message with that public key.</p>

<p>Whenever we are given the opportunity to describe Kali Linux, we use the word “<strong>powerful</strong>”. Have you ever wondered or asked yourself why exactly we consider Kali to be so “Powerful”? Why is Kali any different or better from say, an Ubuntu machine with a bunch of security tools preinstalled on it? After all, <strong>our nmap package isn’t any better than anyone else’s, is it</strong>?</p>
