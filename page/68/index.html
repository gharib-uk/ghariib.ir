		<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is pleased to announce the renewal of the Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS) Level 3 certification under the SS584:2020 standard in December 2024 for the Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and United States AWS Regions, excluding AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This achievement reaffirms our commitment to maintaining the highest security standards for our global customers, particularly those in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>AWS was the first cloud service provider (CSP) to attain MTCS Level 3 certification for Singapore in 2014. We continued this leadership by being among the first CSPs certified under the updated SS584:2020 Level 3 standard in 2021. Our dedication to expanding our security coverage is evident in the significant increase of in-scope services from 145 to 184, representing a 27% growth since 2021.</p>

		<p>In previous articles, we talked about developing concrete AI use cases for your organization and how to kick off your first AI pilot project. The next step? Evolving your artificial intelligence (AI) experiment from a science project into a full-fledged production AI application.There are a lot of factors to consider in this process, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that all this AI stuff is still software. The skills and disciplines you and your teams have developed over the years will all come to bear in this new era of AI, with a few new factors thrown in to keep things exciting.It&rsquo;s also imp</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Bootstrapping (T)FHE Ciphertexts via Automorphisms: Closing the Gap Between Binary and Gaussian Keys</strong><br>
<em>Olivier Bernard, Marc Joye</em></p>
<p>The GINX method in TFHE offers low-latency ciphertext bootstrapping with relatively small bootstrapping keys, but is limited to binary or ternary key distributions. In contrast, the AP method supports arbitrary key distributions, however at the cost of significantly large bootstrapping keys. Building on AP, automorphism-based methods (LMK⁺, EUROCRYPT 2023) achieve smaller keys, though each automorphism application necessitates a key switch, introducing computational overhead and noise. This paper advances automorphism-based methods in two important ways. First, it proposes a novel traversal blind rotation algorithm that optimizes the number of key switches for a given key material. Second, it introduces an automorphism-parametrized external product that seamlessly applies an automorphism to one of the input ciphertexts. Together, these techniques substantially reduce the number of key switches, resulting in faster bootstrapping and improved noise control. As an independent contribution, this paper also introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing the expected number of automorphism key switches, whose predictions perfectly align with the results of extensive numerical experiments, demonstrating its practical relevance. In a typical setting, by utilizing additional key material, the LLW⁺ approach (TCHES 2024) reduces key switches by 17% compared to LMK⁺. Our combined techniques achieve a 46% reduction using similar key material and can eliminate an arbitrary large number (e.g., &gt; 99%) of key switches with only a moderate (9x) increase in key material size.</p>

<p>For years, human risk has been synonymous with cybersecurity awareness training: phishing simulations, compliance courses, and annual reminders to “think before you click.” The landscape, thankfully, is changing. Human risk management is no longer a checkbox activity—it’s becoming a strategic pillar in enterprise risk management, essential for organizational resilience in an increasingly digital and complex world.</p>

		<p>Before we get into it, I would like to thank whatever powers that be who selected my previous post as top 7 featured of the week. I&rsquo;m quite proud of that, and now I&rsquo;m motivated to do more writing, so let&rsquo;s get into it!</p>
<p>After seeing that a certain company in my area (70-ish miles away, close enough) was looking for experience in SvelteKit, I decided to try it out. Most of my experience is in PHP frameworks utilizing Timber/Twig, but I want to get more familiar with JavaScript frameworks. What better way to learn than diving in? What I&rsquo;ve chosen to do is hop on devChallenges, pick a project which comes fully loaded with a design, and go to town. I chose Simple Coffee Listing as my first since it seemed simple enough.</p>
