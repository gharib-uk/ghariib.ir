		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>DL-SCADS: Deep Learning-Based Post-Silicon Side-Channel Analysis Using Decomposed Signal</strong><br>
<em>Dipayan Saha, Farimah Farahmandi</em></p>
<p>Side-channel analysis (SCA) does not aim at the algorithm&rsquo;s weaknesses but rather its implementations. The rise of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) is giving adversaries advanced capabilities to perform stealthy attacks. In this paper, we propose DL-SCADS, a DL-based approach along with signal decomposition techniques to leverage the power of secret key extraction from post-silicon EM/power side-channel traces. We integrate previously proven effective ideas of model ensembling and automated hyperparameter tuning with signal decomposition to develop an efficient and robust side-channel attack. Extensive experiments are performed on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The evaluation of the performance of the side-channel attack employing various decomposition techniques and comparison with the proposed approach in a range of datasets are also tabulated.</p>

<p>I found myself going down a previously unexplored rabbit hole recently, or more specifically, what I thought was &ldquo;a&rdquo; rabbit hole but in actual fact was an ever-expanding series of them that led me to what I refer to in the title of this post as &ldquo;6 rabbits deep&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a tale of firewalls, APIs and sifting through layers and layers of different services to sniff out the root cause of something that seemed very benign, but actually turned out to be highly impactful. Let&rsquo;s go find the rabbits!</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Efficient CPA Attack on Hardware Implementation of ML-DSA in Post-Quantum Root of Trust</strong><br>
<em>Merve Karabulut, Reza Azarderakhsh</em></p>
<p>Side-channel attacks (SCA) pose a significant threat to cryptographic implementations, including those designed to withstand the computational power of quantum computers. This paper introduces the first side-channel attack on an industry-grade post-quantum cryptography implementation, Adam&rsquo;s Bridge. Specifically, we present a Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack targeting the hardware implementation of ML-DSA within Caliptra, an open-source Silicon Root of Trust framework developed through a multi-party collaboration involving Google, AMD, and Microsoft.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Efficient Multi-party Private Set Union Resistant to Maximum Collusion Attacks</strong><br>
<em>Qiang Liu, Joon-Woo Lee</em></p>
<p>Multi-party Private Set Union (MPSU) enables multiple participants to jointly compute the union of their private sets without leaking any additional information beyond the resulting union. Liu et al. (ASIACRYPT 2023) presented the first MPSU protocol that scales to large data sets, designating one participant as the &ldquo;leader&rdquo; responsible for obtaining the final union. However, this approach assumes that the leader does not collude with any other participant, which can be impractical due to the inherent lack of mutual trust among participants, thereby limiting its applicability. On the other hand, the state-of-the-art protocol that allows all participants to learn the computed union was proposed by Seo et al. (PKC 2012). While their construction achieves $O(1)$ round complexity, it remains secure only if fewer than half of the participants collude, leaving open the problem of designing stronger collusion tolerance and multi-party output. In this work, we address these limitations by first proposing $Pi_text{MPSU}^{text{one-leader}}$ that designates one participant as leader to obtain the union result. Building upon this construction, we extend this design to $Pi_text{MPSU}^{text{leaderless}}$, which enables every participant to receive the union result simultaneously. Both protocols operate under the semi-honest model, tolerate maximal collusion among participants, and efficiently handle large-scale set computation. We implement these schemes and conducted a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art solutions. The result shows that, for input sizes of $2^{12}$ at a comparable security level, $Pi_text{MPSU}^{text{one-leader}}$ achieves a $663$ times speedup in online runtime compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it also remains $22$ times faster than half-collusion-tolerant protocol.</p>
