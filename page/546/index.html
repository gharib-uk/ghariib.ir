<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day Eleven</em></p>
<p>Every morning at standup I’d watch the knife spin in slow motion, dread filling my chest and a voice in my head repeating, over and over, “not Slytherin.” (The target of the knife is the author of the next day’s blog post). I wasn’t sure that I could find new ways to marvel at the wonderful absurdity of stepping on a plane and trading reality for this – a chance to work on the world with a group of people that I’ve only admired from afar. I wasn’t sure that I had anything to say that hadn’t already been said by my new friends.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code Day Ten</em></p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/clpwn">Jake</a>, one of the brilliant full-timers on <a href="https://twitter.com/signalapp">Open Whisper Systems</a>, looked up from his laptop and asked me with a smile, “So, Yoko, what’s your life story? How did you come to love humans so much?” It was a whimsical way of asking why I do what I do and why I am here. Having studied Human Computer Interaction and being a user experience (UX) designer, I’ve been asked variations of this question many times before. But it was on this trip I realized my answer needs a little probing.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, an email full of information to help prep for Winter Break of Code popped up in my inbox. Throughout my personal countdown to the day I got to leave San Francisco for Hawaii, one line from that email continuously resonated throughout my mind: “Have your development environment ready to go.”</p>

<p>Yesterday was a day of meetings. Discussion and debate flourished. Conversations ranged over all parts of every project. Words spoken aloud may have outnumbered lines of code shipped. The entire team was fully engaged and people nearly had to be dragged out of the house for an afternoon hike to the top of the ridge.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code, Day 5</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prophetic discourse of the Karai can be summed up in an observation and a promise: on the one hand, they constantly affirmed the fundamentally evil character of the world, on the other, they insisted that conquest of a good world was possible. “The world is evil! The world is ugly!” they said. “Let us abandon it!” they concluded. […] In short, it was not the discourse of the prophets that was unhealthy, but indeed, the world in which they spoke, the society in which they lived.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break Of Code Day 4</em></p>
<p>I’m not sure those attending their first break of code know what they are getting into. When I said <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/">“sure” to Moxie my first break, I sure didn’t</a>. During that week I had already come to the conclusion “I have to see this (TextSecure iOS) through”. In the intervening time, I’ve become an expert on the <a href="http://codexgalactic.com/2014/01/27/axolotl-protocol-for-cryptographically-secure-messaging/">Axolotl protocol</a>, <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/a-whisper/">come to understand ZRTP</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fredericjacobs">picked up the world’s best collaborator</a>, helped with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/signal-private-messenger/id874139669?mt=8">the final polish of Signal with RedPhone support</a> and contributed <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS/graphs/contributors">a lot of code to the TextSecure prototype</a>.</p>

<p>After being promptly woken up by numerous roosters at 7:30 AM, I still can’t believe I’m here. My application was pretty last-minute, completed when I was in a state of droopiness and scholarship-application-hyperdrive. But I got on a plane from the Midwest, went from cloudy, 20 degrees with windchill making it feel like 0 to sunny, 77 degrees with mild winds making it feel still 77 degrees.</p>
