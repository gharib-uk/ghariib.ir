<p>As the world stands today, the future of transaction privacy does not look great. The existing landscape is dominated by traditional credit companies, who over the past decade have been steadily pushing their networks for increased access to user data. They (and their data customers) are on a track to getting SKU level data of every purchase everyone makes everywhere. There are other contenders, such as regional online payments networks (like Venmo in the US), but the data story there is similar.</p>

<p>The latest Signal betas are rolling out today. Inside, you’ll find performance enhancements, a slew of bug fixes, improvements to the mute settings, and if you’re in the United Kingdom, you’ll see support for Signal Payments – a new feature that enables you to send and receive privacy focused payments as easily as sending or receiving a message. This is a beta feature in a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-How-do-I-join-Signal-s-beta-">beta build</a>, but for those in the United Kingdom living life on the edge, please help us test and give feedback.</p>

<p>At the end of October ‘19 I was skimming the <a href="https://github.com/drklo/telegram">Telegram’s android app code</a>, learning about the technologies in use and looking for potentially interesting features. Just a few months earlier, Telegram had introduced the <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/animated-stickers">animated stickers</a>; after reading the blogpost I wondered how they worked <em>under-the-hood</em> and if they created a new image format for it, then forgot about it. Back to the skimming, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/tree/master/TMessagesProj/jni/rlottie"><strong>rlottie</strong> folder</a> and started googling. It turned out to be the <a href="https://github.com/samsung/rlottie">Samsung native library</a> for playing Lottie animations, originally created by <a href="http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/">Airbnb</a>. I don’t know about you but the combination of <strong>Telegram</strong>, <strong>Samsung</strong>, <strong>native</strong> and <strong>animations</strong> instantly triggered my interest in learning more 👀.</p>
