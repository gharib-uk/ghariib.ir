<p>This weekend I successfully completed the <a href="https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops">Red Team Ops</a> exam offered by <a href="https://www.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/">Zero-Point Security</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_rastamouse">Rasta Mouse</a>. This is a red team training course with a focus on exploiting misconfigurations within an Active Directory environment. Completing the lessons earns you a certificate, so if that’s all you want, then you can stop there. However, if you really want to challenge what you’ve learnt, you’ll definitely want to take on the exam.</p>
