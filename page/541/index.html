<p>We have always made all our <a href="https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/build-scripts/">build-scripts</a> public. These are the same set of tools which we use to generate Kali Linux (for each release, or our weekly images). You may have noticed that previously there wasn’t anything about Virtual Machines (VMs). This is because until recently it was a manually done process, which followed our guides (<a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-vmware-guest-vm/">VMware</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/">VirtualBox</a>).
