	<b><time>16.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Hey there, fellow engineers and tech enthusiasts! I’m excited to share one of my favorite strategies for modern software delivery: combining Docker and Jenkins to power up your CI/CD pipelines. </p>
<p>Throughout my career as a Senior DevOps Engineer and Docker Captain, I’ve found that these two tools can drastically streamline releases, reduce environment-related headaches, and give teams the confidence they need to ship faster.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll walk you through what Docker and Jenkins are, why they pair perfectly, and how you can build and maintain efficient pipelines. My goal is to help you feel right at home when automating your workflows. Let’s dive in.</p>

		<p>Without continuous improvement in software security, you’re not standing still — you’re walking backward into oncoming traffic. Attack vectors multiply, evolve, and look for the weakest link in your software supply chain daily. </p>
<p>Cybersecurity Ventures forecasts that the global cost of software supply chain attacks will reach nearly $138 billion by 2031, up from $60 billion in 2025 and $46 billion in 2023. A single overlooked vulnerability isn’t just a flaw; it’s an open invitation for compromise, potentially threatening your entire system. The cost of a breach doesn’t stop with your software — it extends to your reputation and customer trust, which are far harder to rebuild. </p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to their client-side nature, single-page applications (SPAs) will typically have multiple access control vulnerabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By implementing a robust access control policy on supporting APIs, the risks associated with client-side rendering can be largely mitigated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using server-side rendering within the SPA can prevent unauthorized users from modifying or even viewing pages and data that they are not authorized to see</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-55924<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 14, 2025, 8:15 p.m. | 10 hours, 53 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework. A vulnerability has been identified in the backend user interface functionality involving deep links. Specifically, this functionality is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Additionally, state-changing actions in downstream components incorrectly accepted submissions via HTTP GET and did not enforce the appropriate HTTP method. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the victim to have an active session on the backend user interface and to be deceived into interacting with a malicious URL targeting the backend, which can occur under the following conditions: The user opens a malicious link, such as one sent via email. The user visits a compromised or manipulated website while the following settings are misconfigured: 1. `security.backend.enforceReferrer` feature is disabled, 2. `BE/cookieSameSite` configuration is set to lax or none. The vulnerability in the affected downstream component “Scheduler Module” allows attackers to trigger pre-defined command classes - which can lead to unauthorized import or export of data in the worst case. Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 11.5.42 ELTS which fixes the problem described. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.0 | HIGH<br>

<strong>Description :</strong> In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:</p>
<p>ila: serialize calls to nf_register_net_hooks()</p>
<p>syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]</p>
<p>commit 031ae72825ce (&ldquo;ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner&rdquo;) attempted to fix a similar issue.</p>
<p>Looking at the syzbot repro, we have concurrent ILA_CMD_ADD commands.</p>
<p>Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 15, 2025, 10:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 2 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Post Grid and Gutenberg Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions 2.2.85 to 2.3.3. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting what user meta can be updated during profile registration. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register on the site as an administrator.<br>
