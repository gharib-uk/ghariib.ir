		<p>For the upcoming Pwn2Own Automotive contest, a total of four in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) head units have been selected as targets. One of these is the single-DIN Pioneer DMH-WT7600NEX. This unit offers a variety of functionality, such as wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, USB media playback, and more.</p>
<p>This blog post aims to detail some of the attack surfaces of the DMH-WT7600NEX unit as well as provide information on how to extract the software running on this unit for further vulnerability research.</p>

<p>In lieu of high-explosives, an exploding wire circuit can make for an interesting substitute. As [Hyperspace Pirate] demonstrates in a recent video, the act of pumping a lot of current very fast through a thin piece of metal can make for a rather violent detonation. The basic idea is that by having the metal wire (or equivalent) being subjected to a sufficiently large amount of power, it will not just burn through, but effectively vaporize, creating a very localized stream of plasma for the current to keep travelling through and create a major shockwave in the process.</p>

	<div>
		<p>What is the Medusa ransomware? Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) platform that first came to prominence in 2023. The ransomware impacts organisations running Windows, predominantly exploiting vulnerable and unpatched systems and hijacking accounts through initial access brokers. Initial access brokers? Initial access brokers (IABs) specialise in gaining unauthorised access to the networks of organisations, and then sell that access to other cybercriminals - such as ransomware gangs like Medusa. So the ransomware attackers may not be the ones who initially hacked you? Correct. IABs may&hellip;</p>

<p>The following article will try to analyze and explain risks and attack scenarios affecting mobile applications without any implemented prevention mechanism against screenshotting.</p>
<h2 id="briefly-what-is-the-problem">Briefly, what is the problem?</h2>
<p>Extremely summarizing, mobile applications need to implement screenshot prevention mechanisms in order to avoid an attacker to steal sensitive data, such as credentials or private information, that are shown on the screen during the application execution.</p>

<p>The following article will explain how to test mobile applications against any implemented screenshot prevention mechanism and then it will try to propose mitigations to such problem according to the context.</p>
<p>The following article is the second part of <strong>Mobile Screenshot Prevention Cheat Sheet - Risks and Scenarios</strong> published on IMQ Minded Security blog.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>; None of the proposed solutions will provide a full protection against screenshotting. Therefore all of them shall be considered as mitigations.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Compile time does not get as much attention as it once did. Fast machines and compile farms with thousands of machines make time spent compiling seem less important than ever. Most modern priorities are for the program to either run fast or have a small footprint—sometimes both. That does not mean we should ignore compile time. The compiler builds itself, so in some respects compile time is a reflection of how well it generates runtime code.</p>
