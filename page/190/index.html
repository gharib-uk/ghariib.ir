		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Hash-Based Multi-Signatures for Post-Quantum Ethereum</strong><br>
<em>Justin Drake, Dmitry Khovratovich, Mikhail Kudinov, Benedikt Wagner</em></p>
<p>With the threat posed by quantum computers on the horizon, systems like Ethereum must transition to cryptographic primitives resistant to quantum attacks. One of the most critical of these primitives is the non-interactive multi-signature scheme used in Ethereum&rsquo;s proof-of-stake consensus, currently implemented with BLS signatures. This primitive enables validators to independently sign blocks, with their signatures then publicly aggregated into a compact aggregate signature.</p>

<p>You have a project that needs something to move. Should you use a stepper motor or a servo motor? [Matthias] has an opinion, and you can hear his thoughts in the video below. One tip we’ll take away from the video: when working with motors, shoot some high-frame-rate video and slow it down to see what’s really happening.</p>
<p>The initial tests looked fine at normal speed. But increasing the frame rate and decreasing the playback speed showed some very interesting things like how much each motor was overshooting. The ability to control this sort of thing is a key differentiator for these kinds of motors.</p>

		<p>In a compelling keynote address at the 2024 Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit, Jon Smart, former head of ways of working at Barclays and author of <em>Sooner, Safer, Happier</em>, revealed surprising parallels between historical management innovations and modern enterprise challenges. Drawing from extensive research spanning nearly two centuries of industrial evolution, Smart unveiled three critical patterns that continue to shape—and challenge—organizational effectiveness today.</p>
<p>Smart’s presentation, based on his analysis of over 60 historical publications dating from 1776 to 1950, highlighted how modern organizations repeatedly struggle with lessons that were first learned during previous technological revolutions. His research, part of an upcoming book on the centuries-long evolution of working methods, demonstrates that despite technological advancement, core management principles remain remarkably consistent across eras.</p>

<h2 id="innovative-ai-tools-in-scientific-research"><strong>Innovative AI tools in scientific research</strong></h2>
<p>In today’s rapidly evolving world, <strong>AI</strong> is not just transforming industries but also unlocking new opportunities for innovation across almost all sectors, including research. One such opportunity in scientific research is to create an objective method for evaluating the originality of research: an AI-powered tool for novelty scores. By assessing the novelty of studies, i.e. how surprising and innovative yet sensible these studies are, these scores enable industries such as pharmaceutical research &amp; development to quickly identify and gauge areas for innovation more efficiently. This helps significantly speed up the traditional peer review processes. Professor Philipp Koellinger, Co-Founder and CEO of the preprint start-up DeSci Labs, explores how embracing AI in scientific publishing can accelerate progress and drive meaningful advancements across multiple industries.</p>

<p>GenAI is everywhere, and it’s changing how we approach technology. If you’ve ever wanted to dive into the world of large language models (LLMs) but felt intimidated, there’s good news! Hugging Face recently launched a self-paced course that’s perfect for beginners and more experienced enthusiasts alike. It’s hands-on, approachable, and designed to work on standard hardware thanks to the small footprint of the models.</p>
<p>As soon as I heard the news, I decided to give it a go using Canonical’s Data Science Stack (DSS).</p>
