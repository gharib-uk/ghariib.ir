<p><em>Winter Break of Code, Day Four</em></p>
<p>At the Open Whisper Systems <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure/">spring break of code</a> in 2013, I started work on <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/TextSecure-iOS">TextSecure iOS</a>. People are chomping at the bit to use our software on iOS. After a hiatus from the project, I’ve been happy to return to it over the last few months, joining some other contributors, including <a href="https://www.fredericjacobs.com/">Frederic Jacobs</a> as co-lead, <a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3">Alban Diquet</a>, and <a href="http://www.cvursache.com/">Claudiu-Vlad Ursache</a> submitting pull requests, even over the holidays, with important cryptographic storage and UI-polishing contributions, and Bitcoin donations coming in from around the world.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code, Day Three</em></p>
<p>We are at the halfway point of Winter Break of Code. We have two homes near the beach shared by 12 people. 10 of us are working on the apps &amp; website and 2 are leading up delicious dinner efforts. We’ve spent time on the beach, in the ocean, in the mountains, and of course working. Concepts for future startups and tactics about self-publishing books are brewing, and conversations are lined with politics and activism. Work sessions are focused on making cryptography usable in existing Android apps and soon-to-be-released iPhone apps.</p>

<p><em>Winter Break of Code, Day Two</em></p>
<p>By all rights, I should not be here. My application was last-minute to say the least, and little more than a casual note that I’d be down to reprise my role from SBoC as web hacker for whispersystems.org. Maybe it was because of my work in the previous months on tweaking the site layout to be responsive, or because <a href="https://www.twitter.com/bcrypt">@bcrypt</a> (who is infinitely more qualified) was too dedicated to her work at the EFF to take the time off, or because my birthday happened to fall on this week, but for one reason or another, the universe smiled, and here I am.</p>

Off the plane after a pitch-black descent, the humid fresh smell distinct to this place along with my feet landing on soil was a good hint that we were indeed on an island and this was actually happening. It was very welcome.</p>

<p>After our wonderful experience with <a href="https://whispersystems.org/blog/sure">Spring Break Of Code</a>, we were excited to try this again. Even with high expectations based on our experience in the Spring, the response was still better than what we could have hoped for. The hundreds of high-quality proposals we received were really inspiring, and we hope that one day we can get a space large enough for all of the amazing people who are passionate about the development of privacy-enhancing technology.</p>
