		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Multi-Authority Functional Encryption with Bounded Collusions from Standard Assumptions</strong><br>
<em>Rishab Goyal, Saikumar Yadugiri</em></p>
<p>Multi-Authority Functional Encryption ($mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$) [Chase, TCC'07; Lewko-Waters, Eurocrypt'11; Brakerski et al., ITCS'17] is a popular generalization of functional encryption ($mathsf{FE}$) with the central goal of decentralizing the trust assumption from a single central trusted key authority to a group of multiple, independent and non-interacting, key authorities. Over the last several decades, we have seen tremendous advances in new designs and constructions for $mathsf{FE}$ supporting different function classes, from a variety of assumptions and with varying levels of security. Unfortunately, the same has not been replicated in the multi-authority setting. The current scope of $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ designs is rather limited, with positive results only known for (all-or-nothing) attribute-based functionalities, or need full power of general-purpose code obfuscation. This state-of-the-art in $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ could be explained in part by the implication provided by Brakerski et al. (ITCS'17). It was shown that a general-purpose obfuscation scheme can be designed from any $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ scheme for circuits, even if the $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ scheme is secure only in a bounded-collusion model, where at most two keys per authority get corrupted.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Google Android OS, the most severe of which could allow for privilege escalation. Android is an operating system developed by Google for mobile devices, including, but not limited to, smartphones, tablets, and watches. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow for privilege escalation in the context of the affected component. Depending on the privileges associated with the exploited component, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full rights. </p>

<p>Facebook is the most popular social network worldwide, outperforming every other competitor for reach and active users, according to Statista. Further, according to Sprout Social, Facebook is the third-most visited website following Google and YouTube. Thus, when a phishing campaign leverages the Facebook brand, the implications are particularly consequential. Email researchers at Check Point have recently discovered a new Facebook-focused phishing campaign, which has been sent to more than 12,279 email addresses and targets hundreds of companies. The campaign began around December 20th 2024 and has primarily affected enterprises across the EU (45.5%), US (45.0%) and Australia (9.5%). Nonetheless, versions […]</p>

<p>LevelBlue is pleased to announce the launch of the LevelBlue Threat Trends Report! This biannual report, which is a collaboration between various LevelBlue Security Operations teams, is a must-have for security practitioners at organizations of all sizes. It provides relevant, actionable information about ongoing threats as well as guidance on how organizations can work to secure themselves against these threats.</p>
<p>In this edition, our analysts review attacks and threat actor techniques observed by LevelBlue in the second half of 2024 (from June through November). Additionally, our Incident Response team, which provides support and guidance to customers during and after incidents, reviews 12 compromises, 10 of which involved known ransomware groups. In each case, the team recommends hardening and mitigation techniques that can be used to safeguard against these attacks.</p>

		<p>I would be the last one to provide scammers with good ideas, but as a security provider, sometimes we need to think like criminals to stay ahead in the race.</p>
<p>Recently, the US Postal Service (USPS) announced that it would suspend inbound packages from China and Hong Kong until further notice. That further notice, it turned out, was very short indeed, with the USPS announcing on February 5 that the interruption in service would itself be disrupted—packages were once again approved to enter the country. But the whiplash announcements, the second of which was dropped with little fanfare, have caused confusion.</p>

		<p>Attackers are distributing the Tria stealer under the guise of wedding invitations.</p>
<p>Getting married is certainly one of the most important events in anyone’s life. And in many cultures, it’s customary to invite hundreds of guests to the celebration — including some you barely know. Cybervillains take advantage of such traditions, using wedding invitations as bait to launch attacks on Android smartphone users.</p>
<p>Here’s what threat actors have come up with this time, and how to defeat it.</p>

		<p>During 2024’s Birthday Week, we launched an AI bot &amp; crawler traffic graph on Cloudflare Radar that provides visibility into which bots and crawlers are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which crawl on a regular basis, and more. Today, we are launching a new dedicated “AI Insights” page on Cloudflare Radar that incorporates this graph and builds on it with additional metrics that you can use to understand AI-related trends from multiple perspectives. In addition to the traffic trends, the new section includes a view into the relative popularity of publicly available Generative AI services based on 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver traffic, the usage of robots.txt directives to restrict AI bot access to content, and open source model usage as seen by Cloudflare Workers AI.</p>
