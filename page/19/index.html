It&rsquo;s been a while since our last update - a lot has been going on behind the scenes - and with the discovery phase complete we have filed a motion for summary judgement asking the court to dismiss his lawsuit. In it we reveal some of the identities of those who testified regarding their experiences with Chris, and I would like to personally thank them for standing up for our community when remaining silent would have been easier.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Cloud applications and the infrastructure and workloads that power them are mission critical. Today’s organizations need more than the “good enough” visibility offered by lightweight agents. Reliable cloud security leaves nothing to chance — not when an attack can quickly turn into a breach. Organizations need cloud runtime protection that stops threats in real time.</p>
<h2 id="challenges-with-modern-cloud-attacks">Challenges with Modern Cloud Attacks</h2>
<p>As cloud adoption has skyrocketed, adversaries have followed. Up to 80% of security exposures start in the cloud, with 45% of risks changing every month, making them moving targets. Not only do misconfigurations give attackers a direct path to critical resources, but they also enable lateral movement — and often without triggering alarms. Defending the cloud becomes more challenging by the day.</p>

	<b><time>19.03.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In 2024, we announced Log Explorer, giving customers the ability to store and query their HTTP and security event logs natively within the Cloudflare network. Today, we are excited to announce that Log Explorer now supports logs from our Zero Trust product suite. In addition, customers can create custom dashboards to monitor suspicious or unusual activity.</p>
<p>Every day, Cloudflare detects and protects customers against billions of threats, including DDoS attacks, bots, web application exploits, and more. SOC analysts, who are charged with keeping their companies safe from the growing spectre of Internet threats, may want to investigate these threats to gain additional insights on attacker behavior and protect against future attacks. Log Explorer, by collecting logs from various Cloudflare products, provides a single starting point for investigations. As a result, analysts can avoid forwarding logs to other tools, maximizing productivity and minimizing costs. Further, analysts can monitor signals specific to their organizations using custom dashboards.</p>
