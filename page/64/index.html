		<p>Can anyone blame him, though?</p>
<p>Back in December 2024, we saw the then-CEO of Intel Pat Gelsinger step down from his position. Intel was on a pretty bad streak of luck at the time, which only just turned around after the company saw success with its Battlemage GPUs. Well, it seems one person had his back at least, as Bill Gates said he had some faith in him during a recent interview.</p>

<p>For the third consecutive year, Check Point ranked #1 for security effectiveness in all categories of the Miercom Enterprise and Hybrid Mesh Firewall Report. This report includes two new metrics: SSE/SASE Threat Prevention and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs). Miercom’s independent, head-to-head stress testing establishes how well a platform can detect and block the latest generations of cyber security threats in real-world scenarios. Blocking at least 99% of cyber attacks is a key objective, because even a 90% block rate can translate to hundreds of costly attacks. Organizations subject to these attacks can face data loss, credential theft, ransomware demands, and […]</p>

		<p>Interesting analysis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections Project (source for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.</p>
<p>We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em> AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions&hellip;</p>

		<p>Picture this: Product and Development teams are working in isolation. Product has created a 12-month roadmap and communicated it to internal stakeholders but didn&rsquo;t review it with their development team. Dev starts building the features planned for the upcoming sprint without considering the broader product roadmap, leading to missed opportunities to optimize timing, like running projects in parallel, accounting for team capacity, or building reusable APIs that could serve multiple initiatives. The lack of coordination results in inefficiencies and delayed value delivery.</p>

		<p>Secrets left exposed in outdated repositories pose significant risk for data breaches. For example, a still-active secret key can be exposed, leaving it vulnerable to exploitation. Secrets include access keys, API tokens, private keys, and other sensitive values.</p>
<p>In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn how to use GitLab Secret Detection to scan a repository’s full commit history, including all branches, to detect sensitive secrets. In addition, you will discover how to view the results directly within the GitLab UI without the need for any integration. All it takes is just a couple of lines of code in your <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> pipeline file.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted and “possibly compromised.”</p>
<p>It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers, Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the alleged attacks&hellip;</p>

		<p>A paradigm shift in technology is hurtling towards us, and it could change everything we know about cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Uhh, again, that is.</p>
<p>When ChatGPT was unveiled to the public in late 2022, security experts looked on with cautious optimism, excited about the new technology but concerned about its use in cyberattacks. But two years on, much of what ChatGPT and other generative AI chat tools offer attackers is a way to improve what already works, not new ways to deliver attacks themselves.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;new Outlook&rdquo; (introduced in 2022) has been promoted as an upgrade, but its implementation introduces severe data protection concerns - so severe that it&rsquo;s fair to say it&rsquo;s a downgrade rather than an upgrade. Regardless, Microsoft increasingly pushes personal and business Outlook users to switch to the new Outlook. But IT admins should be warned: If employees press the toggle to switch to the new Outlook, they risk unintentional breaches of data protection laws, as all emails and login credentials are automatically stored on Microsoft’s cloud servers. This poses significant compliance issues, especially for businesses handling sensitive data.</p>
