		<p>Hello friends! Today, we will learn how to put Minikube on your Ubuntu computer. Minikube is a tool that runs Kubernetes, a very popular thing for managing apps, on your own machine. It’s easy to do, and I’ll show you everything step by step. We will also need kubectl (a command tool for Kubernetes) and Docker (a tool to run containers). Don’t worry, I’ll explain it all in simple words like we’re chatting!</p>

		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Apache Tomcat, which could allow for remote code execution. Apache Tomcat is an open-source Java servlet container and web server used to host Java-based web applications and implement Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications, providing a platform for running dynamic web content. Successful exploitation of the of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data.</p>

		<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Trimble Cityworks that could allow for remote code execution. Trimble Cityworks is a system that helps manage the lifecycle of assets for public infrastructure. It uses GIS (geographic information systems) to help with tasks such as permitting, licensing, construction, maintenance, and replacement. Successful exploitation of the of this vulnerability could allow for remote code execution in the context of the system. Depending on the privileges associated with the system, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

		<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) helps drive innovation by helping organizations better leverage their data to gain valuable insights. Enterprises are rapidly adopting AI applications, but developing, training and managing AI workloads at scale remains a challenge. Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) helps address this challenge by enabling enterprises to operationalize AI models as scalable services.What is Model-as-a-Service (MaaS)?Model-as-a-service (MaaS) provides pre-trained AI models via APIs on a hybrid cloud AI platform using a pay-as-you-go pricing.

		<p>Heutzutage wird das Active Directory (AD) von Angreifern sehr häufig ins Visier genommen, denn es ist eine Art Generalschlüssel, der den Zugang zum gesamten Netzwerk ermöglicht. AD stellt die Verzeichnisdienste bereit, mit denen Administratoren im gesamten Netzwerk Berechtigungen verwalten und Zugriff auf Ressourcen gewähren. Es ist somit für die täglichen Abläufe eines Unternehmens unverzichtbar – und […]</p>

		<p>In May 2024, Cloudflare signed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Secure By Design pledge. Since then, Cloudflare has been working to enhance the security of our products, ensuring that users are better protected from evolving threats. </p>
<p>Today we are excited to talk about the improvements we have made towards goal number one in the pledge, which calls for increased multi-factor authentication (MFA) adoption. MFA takes many forms across the industry, from app-based and hardware key authentication, to email or SMS. Since signing the CISA pledge we have continued to iterate on our MFA options for users, and most recently added support for social logins with Apple and Google, building on the strong foundation that both of these partners offer their users with required MFA for most accounts. Since introducing social logins last year, about 25% of our users use it weekly, and it makes up a considerable portion of our MFA secured users. There’s much more to do in this space, and we are continuing to invest in more options to help secure your accounts. </p>
