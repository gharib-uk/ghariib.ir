		<p>Cybersecurity researchers have exposed critical vulnerabilities in a telecom network that allowed unauthorized access to sensitive data and control over 3,000 companies. </p>
<p>The research revealed obvious vulnerabilities in the network’s backend APIs, authentication systems, and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, raising serious concerns about the state of cybersecurity in telecommunications. </p>
<h2 id="how-did-the-exploit-begin"><strong>How did the Exploit begin?</strong></h2>
<p>Cybersecurity researchers Abdulaziz and Omar discovered an endpoint in the telecom network that returned unusual responses when manipulated with special characters. </p>

<p>In today&rsquo;s cloud-native world, applications need to handle fluctuating traffic efficiently. Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) helps by <strong>automatically scaling pods</strong> based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.</p>
<p>🔹 <strong>Why It Matters Now?</strong></p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Cost Efficiency</strong> – Avoid over-provisioning and reduce cloud bills.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Performance Optimization</strong> – Ensures smooth user experience under high loads.</p>
<p>✔️ <strong>Automation &amp; Flexibility</strong> – Dynamically adjusts based on real-time demand.</p>
<p>💡 <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> If your Kubernetes apps need <strong>scalability, resilience, and cost control</strong>, HPA is a must-have!</p>

<p>For many people of a certain age, the DEC VAX was the first computer they ever used. They were everywhere, powerful for their day, and relatively affordable for schools and businesses. These minicomputers were smaller than the mainframes of their day, but bigger than what we think of as a computer today. So even if you could find an old one in working order, it would be a lot more trouble than refurbishing, say, an old Commodore 64. But if you want to play on a VAX, you might want to get a free membership on DECUServe, a service that will let you remotely access a VAX in all its glory.</p>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-10574<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 26, 2025, 6:15 a.m. | 2 hours, 22 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The Quiz Maker Business, Developer, and Agency plugins for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the &lsquo;ays_save_google_credentials&rsquo; function in all versions up to, and including, 8.8.0 (Business), up to, and including, 21.8.0 (Developer), and up to, and including, 31.8.0 (Agency). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Sheets integration credentials within the plugin&rsquo;s settings. Because the &lsquo;client_id&rsquo; parameter is not sanitized or escaped when used in output, this vulnerability could also be leveraged to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 7.2 | HIGH<br>
