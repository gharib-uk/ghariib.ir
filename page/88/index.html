		<p>Attacks on supply chains were one of the biggest threats in 2024. We discuss the most notable incidents of last year, and their consequences for the attacked.</p>
<p>A supply-chain attack can totally thwart all a targeted company’s efforts to protect its infrastructure. Preventing such attacks is extremely difficult because a significant portion of an attack occurs in infrastructure that’s not within the security team’s control. This makes supply-chain attacks one of the most dangerous threats in recent years, and today we’ll look at some of the biggest that took place in 2024.</p>

		<p>Last month, we focused on how building high-performing teams is a key differentiator of organizational success. Paramount to long-term success is the ability of your employees and teams to continuously learn, adapt, and innovate—what many have called a learning culture or culture of continuous learning.</p>
<p>As the guidance paper “How to Thrive (or Fail) in Building a Learning Culture” states, “Organizations that cultivate a culture of learning possess a distinct competitive advantage—one that allows them to stay ahead of the curve, anticipate shifts in the market, and deliver exceptional value to customers.”</p>

<p>Healthcare systems in high-income countries are at breaking point. An ageing population, soaring demand for services, and widespread burnout among professionals have created a perfect storm.</p>
<p>According to a report by BMJ Global Health, it is estimated that 13.7 million new health workers will be needed by 2030 globally to compensate for attrition due to retirements.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>The Nonlinear Filter Model of Stream Cipher Redivivus</strong><br>
<em>Claude Carlet, Palash Sarkar</em></p>
<p>The nonlinear filter model is an old and well understood approach to the design of secure stream ciphers. Extensive research over several decades has shown how to attack stream ciphers based on this model and has identified the security properties required of the Boolean function used as the filtering function to resist such attacks. This led to the problem of constructing Boolean functions which provide adequate security and at the same time are efficient to implement. Unfortunately, over the last two decades no good solutions to this problem appeared in the literature. The lack of good solutions has effectively led to nonlinear filter model becoming more or less obsolete. This is a big loss to the cryptographic design toolkit, since the great advantages of the nonlinear filter model are its simplicity, well understood security and the potential to provide low cost solutions for hardware oriented stream ciphers. In this paper we construct balanced functions on an odd number $ngeq 5$ of variables with the following provable properties: linear bias equal to $2^{-lfloor n/2rfloor -1}$, algebraic degree equal to $2^{lfloor log_2lfloor n/2rfloor rfloor}$, algebraic immunity at least $lceil (n-1)/4rceil$, fast algebraic immunity at least $1+lceil (n-1)/4rceil $, and can be implemented using $O(n)$ NAND gates. The functions are obtained from a simple modification of the well known class of Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. By appropriately choosing $n$ and the length $L$ of the linear feedback shift register, we show that it is possible to obtain examples of stream ciphers which are $kappa$-bit secure against known types of attacks for various values of $kappa$. We provide concrete proposals for $kappa=80,128,160,192,224$ and $256$. For the $80$-bit, $128$-bit, and the $256$-bit security levels, the circuits for the corresponding stream ciphers require about 1743.5, 2771.5, and 5607.5 NAND gates respectively. For the $80$-bit and the $128$-bit security levels, the gate count estimates compare quite well to the famous ciphers Trivium and Grain-128a respectively, while for the $256$-bit security level, we do not know of any other stream cipher design which has such a low gate count.</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>As software applications grow in complexity and scale, manual testing becomes increasingly impractical. Test automation emerges as a crucial solution, enabling teams to validate software functionality efficiently and consistently.</p>
<p>By implementing automated testing processes, organizations can significantly increase their testing frequency while maintaining accuracy and reducing human error.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-automated-testing">Benefits of Automated Testing</h2>
<p>Consistent and repeatable test execution</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid feedback on code changes</li>
<li>Increased test coverage across the application</li>
<li>Reduced manual testing effort for repetitive tasks</li>
<li>Enhanced ability to perform regression testing</li>
<li>Improved confidence in code changes</li>
</ul>
<p>When implementing test automation, teams should focus on identifying tests that offer the highest return on investment. Repetitive, predictable, and time-consuming tests are prime candidates for automation.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Feb. 4, 2025</p>
<p>Cybercrime is among the most significant threats to modern businesses—no matter the size of the company or its sector. With Cybersecurity Ventures predicting that the damage costs will be $10.5 trillion globally in 2025—enough to make it the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China—cybercrime has become an unavoidable business risk that affects every organization with digital assets.</p>

		<p>Educational technology, or EdTech, is revolutionizing the way we learn and teach. By integrating advanced tools and digital platforms into educational systems, EdTech is creating more personalized, efficient, and accessible learning experiences for students worldwide. From K-12 schools to universities and corporate training programs, the impact of technology in education is profound and growing.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Learning Experiences</strong></p>
<p>One of the most significant advancements in EdTech is the ability to offer personalized learning experiences. Adaptive learning platforms use artificial intelligence to analyze a student’s strengths, weaknesses, and learning pace. These systems then tailor content and assessments to meet individual needs, ensuring that each student can progress at their own speed. This approach is particularly effective in bridging learning gaps and supporting students with diverse abilities.</p>

<p>There’s good news in the US federal compliance space. The latest FedRAMP policy on the use of cryptographic modules relaxes some of the past restrictions that prevented organizations from applying critical security updates.</p>
<p>There has long been a tension between the requirements for strictly certified FIPS crypto modules and the need to keep software patched and up to date with the latest security vulnerability fixes. The new guidance goes a ways to resolving this tension – and best of all, it aligns perfectly with how we’ve already been approaching FIPS module updates for Ubuntu.</p>
