<p>P2P networks are more scalable and robust than traditional C/S structures, and these advantages were recognized by the botnet authors early on and used in their botnets. In terms of time, Storm, which appeared in 2007, can be considered the progenitor of this area, when botnet threats were first known to the public. after Storm, there have been Karen, ZeroAccess, GameOver, Hijime, mozi and other kinds of P2P botnes, P2P botnets come and go, and some, for example, Mozi keep on going even though the author had been caught.</p>

		<p>Unless you have been gifted with a photographic memory, this is likely going to sound very familiar. Picture it: You’re away from your desk and you need to access one of your apps from your phone. You attempt to sign in and get the dreaded message: “the username and password entered do not match our records.” Thus begins the time-consuming process of requesting a password reset, including coming up with a new password that doesn’t match something you’ve already used in the past. Despite the frustration you feel, passwords have been the cornerstone of keeping our online data secure fo</p>

		<p>For decades users have been pressing Ctrl+C or relying on copy buttons. All these tricks and shortcuts to speed up text processing have become natural and intuitive to us. We do not pay attention to what is happening to copied information besides the fact that we can paste it. It’s safe to assume that most of us consider the clipboard as temporary data sharing. Once you copy something previous data in the clipboard will be overwritten. People rely on this assumption when they copy sensitive information such as passwords.</p>

		<p>In our daily botnet analysis work, it is common to encounter various loaders.Compared to other types of malware, loaders are unique in that they are mainly used to &ldquo;promote&rdquo;, i.e., download and run other malware on the infected machine. According to our observations, most loaders are proprietary and have a binding relationship with the family they are promoting. A few loader families make themselves into promotion platforms that can spread any other malware family, achieving the so-called malware-as-a-service (MaaS). Compared with proprietary loaders, MaaS types are obviously more dangerous and should be our primary target of concern.</p>

<p>With so much data being thrown at our eyeballs these days, it’s worryingly easy for the actually important stuff to slip by occasionally. So when [Liam Jackson] wanted a way to visualize the number of test failures popping up in the continuous integration system at work, he went with a novel but effective solution — universal motorcycle tachometers.</p>
<p>It turns out these little gauges can be had for under $10 a piece from the usual overseas retailers, and are very easy to drive with a microcontroller. As [Liam] explains, all you need to do other than providing them with 12 volts, is feed them a PWM signal. Even though the gauges are designed for a 12 V system, they apparently don’t have any problem responding to the 5 V logic level from the Arduino’s pins.</p>

		<p>At Mozilla, we believe in an open web that is safe to use. To that end, we improve and maintain the security of people using Firefox around the world. This includes a solid track record of responding to security bugs in the wild, especially with bug bounty programs such as Pwn2Own. As soon as we discover a critical security issue in Firefox, we plan and ship a rapid fix. This post describes how we recently fixed an exploit discovered at Pwn2Own in less than 21 hours, a success only made possible through the collaborative and well-coordinated efforts of a global cross-functional team of release and QA engineers, security experts, and other stakeholders.</p>
