<p>The artificial intelligence arms race has a new disruptor—DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has quickly gained traction for its advanced language models.  </p>
<p>Positioned as a low-cost alternative to industry giants like OpenAI and Meta, DeepSeek has drawn attention for its rapid growth, affordability, and potential to reshape the AI landscape.  </p>
<p>But as the buzz around its capabilities grows, so do concerns about data privacy, cybersecurity, and the implications of feeding personal information into AI tools with uncertain oversight. </p>

	<b><time>01.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>Researchers have uncovered two critical vulnerabilities in GitHub Copilot, Microsoft’s AI-powered coding assistant, that expose systemic weaknesses in enterprise AI tools. </p>
<p>The flaws—dubbed “Affirmation Jailbreak” and “Proxy Hijack”—allow attackers to bypass ethical safeguards, manipulate model behavior, and even hijack access to premium AI resources like OpenAI’s GPT-o1.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the ease with which AI systems can be manipulated, raising critical concerns about the security and ethical implications of AI-driven development environments.</p>

		<p>Google announced today it blocked a record 2.28 million policy-violating apps from entering the Play Store in 2023, leveraging advanced machine learning, stricter developer vetting, and cross-industry collaborations to combat evolving cyberthreats. </p>
<p>The milestone underscores efforts to uphold its SAFE principles (Safeguard Users, Advocate for Developer Protection, Foster Responsible Innovation, Evolve Platform Defenses), which anchor its security strategy.</p>

<p>It was Dan and Elliot behind the microphones today for a transatlantic look at the week in hacks. There was a bucket of news about AI, kicked off by Deepseek suddenly coming into the zeitgeist and scaring the pants off investors for… reasons? No matter, we’re more interested in the tech anyway, such as a deep dive into deep space communications from a backyard antenna farm that’s carefully calibrated to give the HOA fits. We got down and dirty with capacitors, twice even, and looked at a clever way to stuff two websites into one QR code. It’s all Taylor, all the time on every channel of the FM band, which we don’t recommend you do (for multiple reasons) but it’s nice to know you can. Plus, great kinetic art project, but that tooling deserves a chef’s kiss. Finally, we wrap up with our Can’t Miss articles where Jenny roots for the right to repair, and Al gives us the <code>finger(1)</code>.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a sophisticated campaign leveraging GitHub’s trusted release infrastructure to distribute the Lumma Stealer malware.</p>
<p>This information-stealing malware, part of a growing trend of cybercriminals abusing legitimate platforms, poses significant risks by exfiltrating sensitive data and deploying additional malicious payloads.</p>
<p>The attackers utilized GitHub repositories to host malicious files disguised as legitimate software.</p>
<p>In one example, users were tricked into downloading files such as <code>Pictore.exe</code> and <code>App_aelGCY3g.exe</code> from GitHub-hosted URLs.</p>

<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 30, 2025</p>
<p>Modern defensive cyber solutions, while impressive, have failed in the face of cheap and easy-to-create – and most importantly lucrative – ransomware, according to Austin, Texas-based Halcyon, an anti-ransomware company.</p>
<p>Halcyon claims to have built the first anti-ransomware engine to tackle this problem. Their team has spent decades building name-brand security products and delivering security consulting to much of the Fortune 500.</p>
