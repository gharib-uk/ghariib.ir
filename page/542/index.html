<p>We have really enjoyed doing the <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/kali-linux.html"><strong>Dojo at Black Hat</strong></a> the last few years. It’s been a great opportunity to show off some of the lesser known (but oh so useful) <a href="https://www.kali.org/features/">features of Kali Linux</a> as well as interact with the user base. But one of the limitations of the previous structure was that while this was a hands-on exercise, many attendees moved at different paces from each other. So we wanted to move towards more of a “self service” model where <strong>attendees can drop in, have access to the training material, and will be free to work at their own pace</strong>. We accomplished with the new model we will be premiering this year, allowing everyone to take as much, or as little, time needed to get a working Kali install customized to their desires. While this is being done, <strong>Kali developers will be onsite and interacting with everyone</strong> on a consistent basis.</p>
