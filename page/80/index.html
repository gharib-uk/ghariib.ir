	<div>
		<p>DPRK &lsquo;Contagious Interview&rsquo; campaign continues to target Mac users with new variants of FERRET malware and Github devs with repo spam.</p>
<p>Last week Apple pushed a signature update to its on-device malware tool XProtect to block several variants of what it called the macOS Ferret family: FROSTYFERRET_UI, FRIENDLYFERRET_SECD, and MULTI_FROSTYFERRET_CMDCODES. This DPRK-attributed malware family was first described by researchers in December and further in early January and identified as part of the North Korean Contagious Interview campaign, in which threat actors lure targets to install malware through the job interview process.</p>

<p>If you’re like most makers, you have a few product ideas kicking about, but you may not have made it all the way to production of those things. If you’re thinking about making the leap, [Simone Giertz] recently discussed all the perils and pitfalls of the process from idea to reality.</p>

		<p>A California man has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his involvement in a fraudulent scheme that saw over 50 individuals and organisations lose millions of dollars. 59-year-old Allen Giltman, of Irvine, California, pleaded guilty to charges that he and his co-conspirators built a network of fraudulent websites impersonating legitimate financial institutions. According to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) press release, between 2012 and October 2020, Giltman and others created a series of at least 150 bogus websites that posed as real financial institutions.

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When it comes to endpoint detection and response (EDR) compatibility within an MDR offering, managed service providers (MSPs) are weighing two key priorities: native EDR integration or the flexibility to support multiple solutions. According to a recent OpenText survey, opinions are split almost evenly. While 52% of MSPs view native compatibility as moderately or very important, 48% place greater value on flexibility.</p>
<p>This divide reflects the unique demands MSPs face. On one hand, native compatibility ensures a tight integration. On the other, the ability to work seamlessly with various EDR tools is critical for MSPs managing diverse client environments. For MSPs managing a mix of EDR tools across their customer base, this adaptability can be the difference between a smooth operation and a logistical headache.</p>

<p>Microsoft has started testing a new “scareware blocker” feature for the Edge web browser on Windows PCs, which uses machine learning (ML) to detect tech support scams.</p>
<p>Scareware scams (also known as tech support scams) have been a pervasive threat for years. The scammers use aggressive landing pages to persuade potential victims that their devices have been compromised with malware and then try to gain remote access to targets’ systems by pressuring them to call a fake tech support number.</p>

The project operates under community governance, ensuring features and fixes align with the community. All of the Terraform providers worked with OpenTofu with the OpenTofu registry.</p>
<h2 id="executing-the-migration">Executing the Migration</h2>
<p>The migration to OpenTofu is a straightforward process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install OpenTofu using your preferred package manager or download the binary from the OpenTofu releases page.</li>
<li>Update your scripts and CI/CD configurations to use the <code>tofu</code> command instead of <code>terraform</code>:</li>
</ol>
