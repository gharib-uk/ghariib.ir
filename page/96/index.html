	<div>
		<p>I am working on a AI model that have a few files larger than 10MiB of trained model. While pushing those models to huggingface repository I got an error saying the files are too large to upload. Hugging Face has a size limit for single files, and files larger than 10MiB need special handling. This means I need to change the way I upload or store these files.</p>
<p>This article will help you understand why this error happens and how you can fix it. You will learn how to push large files to a Hugging Face repository step by step.</p>

		<p>If you want to improve your productivity and work more efficiently, Alfred is simply unmatched for Mac users.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a Spotlight replacement on your Mac that can aid in productivity, there&rsquo;s no better option than Alfred. Alfred is a complete third-party replacement for Spotlight search. It offers a far more extensible and powerful platform with plenty of configuration, while retaining the same speed, ease of access, and sleek design that Spotlight is known for. While Apple&rsquo;s default Spotlight search is a powerful tool for accessing apps, files, or searching the internet, it pales in comparison to Alfred.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 23, 2025, 6:15 p.m. | 26 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python language which allows to provide a program input into a trusted environment. Via a type confusion bug in versions of the CPython interpreter starting in 3.11 and prior to 3.13.2 when using `try/except*`, RestrictedPython starting in version 6.0 and prior to version 8.0 could be bypassed. The issue is patched in version 8.0 of RestrictedPython by removing support for `try/except*` clauses. No known workarounds are available.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 7.9 | HIGH<br>

		<p>As organizations increase in size, it becomes increasingly difficult and critical to ensure that the right team members have access to the right groups and projects within their development platform. GitLab offers some powerful methods to manage user access, especially now with custom roles, but performing this at scale through a point-and-click user interface can be frustrating. However, all is not lost. You can use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) as a solution. (There are moments where I’m grateful for acronyms.)</p>

		<p>Give your laptop more graphical grunt with an eGPU.</p>
<p>PC gaming is one of the most popular pastimes in the world, and based on Steam&rsquo;s Hardware Survey, a significant percentage of those gamers are playing using a gaming laptop. And, we can see why, because even the most basic laptop is more powerful than a PC gaming handheld, and gives a better experience with a larger screen.</p>
