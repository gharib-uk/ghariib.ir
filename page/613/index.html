	<div>
		<p>With generative artificial intelligence (gen AI) on the frontlines of information security, red teams play an essential role in identifying vulnerabilities that others can overlook.</p>
<p>With the average cost of a data breach reaching an all-time high of $4.88 million in 2024, businesses need to know exactly where their vulnerabilities lie. Given the remarkable pace at which they’re adopting gen AI, there’s a good chance that some of those vulnerabilities lie in AI models themselves — or the data used to train them.</p>

<p>DEF CON 32 has wound down, and we want to thank our community for making this one stellar. You never fail to bring gigantic love and enthusiasm to every aspect of the Con, and we are inspired by your example.</p>
<p>The curveball of a sudden, late-stage venue scramble could have spelled disaster, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Having so much of the Con back under one roof felt great! FIrst years in a new venue always mean some hiccups and learning experiences, but you reacted with patience and grace when they happened. For this you have our eternal gratitude.</p>

<p>With just a few days left before Christmas, overwhelmed shipping services might fail to deliver your gifts on time. Of course, you could always get a last-minute digital gift-card or subscription — but the fact is that everyone who might be interested in a Netflix or Spotify account probably already has one. And Telegram Premium? That’s a little awkward just now.</p>

		<p>A Divisive Veto: California Rejects AI Safety Bill SB 1047 California Governor Gavin Newsom’s recent veto of SB 1047, a proposed AI safety bill, has sparked a hot debate on the balance between innovation and regulation in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. California has over a dozen AI related bills that have been signed although this bill sought to establish rigorous safety testing requirements for large-scale AI models and introduce an emergency &ldquo;kill switch&rdquo; for situations where systems might become dangerous. Newsom’s veto shines a light on the ongoing tensions between the tech&hellip;</p>

		<p>At Fortra, we like to encourage a collaborative environment. One of the ways we bring our community together is through our Transformer meetups which aim to provide a positive, energizing, and fun hub for all Fortra employees to learn how to be innovative, get inspired by others, and reach their creative potential. Our most recent meetup was moderated by myself and our panelists were Tyler Reguly, John Wilson, Bob Erdman, and Nathan Ramaker. The conversation was so insightful, that we wanted to share some of the discussion with others in this blog. Joe Pettit: October was National&hellip;</p>

<p>In Q3 2024, McAfee Labs identified a sharp rise in the Remcos RAT threat. It has emerged as a significant threat in the world of cybersecurity, gaining traction with its ability to infiltrate systems and compromise sensitive data. This malware, often delivered through phishing emails and malicious attachments, allows cybercriminals to remotely control infected machines, making it a powerful tool for espionage, data theft, and system manipulation. As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, understanding the mechanisms behind RemcosRAT and adopting effective security measures are crucial to protecting your systems from this growing threat. This blog presents a technical analysis of two RemcosRAT variants</p>

<p>The art of writing has become a cluttered one to follow, typically these days through a graphical word processor. There may be a virtual page in front of you, but it’s encumbered by much UI annoyance. To combat this a variety of distraction free software and appliances have been created over the years.</p>
<p>But it’s perhaps [Liam Proven]’s one we like the most — it’s a bootable 16-bit DOS environment with a selection of simple text and office packages on board. No worries about being distracted by social media when you don’t even have networking.</p>
