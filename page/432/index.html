		<p>The threat of cyberattacks looms larger than ever before. As cybercriminals develop more sophisticated methods, traditional security measures often fall short, necessitating innovative solutions. Enter artificial intelligence (AI), a game-changing technology that is rewriting the rules of cybersecurity management.</p>

<p>AI has positioned itself at the forefront of the cybersecurity landscape by enhancing capabilities such as threat detection and incident response. Techniques like user behavior analytics and anomaly detection not only identify potential breaches but also predict risks before they materialize. As organizations strive for more resilient security frameworks, AI serves as a catalyst for change, offering unprecedented analytical prowess and operational efficiency.</p>

	<b><time>02.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>In mid-October, we released our 2024 Microsoft Digital Defense Report, which revealed over 600 million identity attacks per day. As multifactor authentication now blocks most password-based attacks, we’re seeing a shift in threat actor tactics and a convergence of nation-state and cybercriminal threat activity. More than 99% of identity attacks are password attacks—often due to predictable human behaviors like easy-to-guess passwords, password reuse, and falling prey to phishing attacks.1 That’s why comprehensive, integrated identity and access management (IAM) should be a core part of any organization’s threat-informed defense. Today we’re honored to announce that for the eighth year in a row, Microsoft has been named a Leader in the 2024 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management—placed highest on the Ability to Execute axis. </p>
