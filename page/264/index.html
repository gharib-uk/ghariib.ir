		<p>Suzie Prince, Head of Product at Atlaasian recently spoke with Abi Noda, CEO at DX, and Andrew Boyagi, Head of DevOps Evangelism at Atlassian, about how AI is changing software development. They shared valuable insights on the best practices for using generative AI (GenAI) tools on your developer teams, how to get value from developer portals, and the latest approaches for measuring developer productivity.</p>
<p>Here are five key takeaways from this conversation on strategies for leveraging AI to boost developer productivity and experience.</p>

		<p>Misalignment between engineers and their leaders is possibly the leading cause of a sub-optimal developer experience and, consequently, poor productivity.</p>
<p>See for yourself here</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have moved on from a time when a positive developer experience meant buying a few ping-pong tables and ordering pizza on a Friday. Leaders understand that improving developer experience is about removing friction from the developer’s daily work and is a key input to productivity and retaining talent. But how closely do leadership attitudes match with what developers experience?</p>

		<p>Although the process may seem slow, we are steadily progressing toward rolling out the New Boards Hub to all customers. Our plan is to deprecate the old Boards experience for all Azure DevOps service users by the end Q1 2025.</p>
<p>The rollout is advancing on two fronts. First, we are setting the New Boards Hub as the default experience. Second, for customers who already have the New Boards Hub enabled as the default, we are transitioning groups to exclusively use the New Boards Hub. Removing the option to revert to the old Boards experience.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>New Quantum Cryptanalysis of Binary Elliptic Curves (Extended Version)</strong><br>
<em>Kyungbae Jang, Vikas Srivastava, Anubhab Baksi, Santanu Sarkar, Hwajeong Seo</em></p>
<p>This paper improves upon the quantum circuits required for the Shor&rsquo;s attack on binary elliptic curves. We present two types of quantum point addition, taking both qubit count and circuit depth into consideration.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose an in-place point addition that improves upon the work of Banegas et al. from CHES'21, reducing the qubit count – depth product by more than $73%$ – $81%$ depending on the variant. Furthermore, we develop an out-of-place point addition by using additional qubits. This method achieves the lowest circuit depth and offers an improvement of over $92%$ in the qubit count – quantum depth product (for a single step).</p>

<p>At this point, many of us have gone all-in on USB-C. It’s gotten to the point that when you occasionally run across a gadget that <em>doesn’t</em> support being powered USB-C, the whole experience seems somewhat ridiculous. If 90% of your devices using the same power supply, that last 10% starts feeling very antiquated.</p>
<p>So why should your breadboard be any different? [Axiometa] has recently unveiled a simple PCB that will plug into a standard solderless breadboard to provide 3.3 and 5 VDC when connected to a USB-C power supply. The device is going to start a crowdfunding campaign soon if you want to buy a completed one — but with the design files and Bill of Materials already up on GitHub, nothing stops you from spinning up your own version today.</p>

		<p>Starting March 3, 2025, we will no longer accept new registrations of Azure DevOps OAuth apps. This is the first step we’ll be taking towards our longer-term vision of sunsetting the Azure DevOps OAuth platform. Moving forward, we’ll be publicly advocating all developers that are building applications on top of Azure DevOps REST APIs to explore the Microsoft Identity platform and registering a new Entra application instead.</p>
<p>All existing Azure DevOps OAuth apps will continue working until the official end-of-life date, which we will announce in 2025. In the interim, we offer continued support to all current Azure DevOps OAuth app developers.</p>

<p>The modern-day cyber threat landscape is marked by the rise in malware variants that give attackers the green light to gain complete remote control over targeted systems, such as a nefarious Remcos RAT spread via a phishing attack vector. At the turn of January 2025, defenders unveiled an emerging stealthy malware dubbed NonEuclid RAT, which is enriched with sophisticated offensive capabilities, like advanced detection evasion techniques, privilege escalation, and ransomware encryption.</p>
