<p>DevOps is a set of practices that aims to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). By emphasizing automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, DevOps ensures that software is delivered faster, more reliably, and with higher quality. DevOps is often structured into four key stages, each playing a vital role in optimizing the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>These four stages—<strong>Plan</strong>, <strong>Develop</strong>, <strong>Build</strong>, and <strong>Monitor</strong>—represent the continuous process of software delivery. By understanding and optimizing these stages, organizations can streamline their development processes and deliver better products to their customers. This post will explore each of these stages in detail, highlighting their major features and importance in the DevOps pipeline.</p>
