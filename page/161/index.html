		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Post-Quantum Threshold Ring Signature Applications from VOLE-in-the-Head</strong><br>
<em>James Hsin-Yu Chiang, Ivan Damgård, William R. Duro, Sunniva Engan, Sebastian Kolby, Peter Scholl</em></p>
<p>We propose efficient, post-quantum threshold ring signatures constructed from one-wayness of AES encryption and the VOLE-in-the-Head zero-knowledge proof system. Our scheme scales efficiently to large rings and extends the linkable ring signatures paradigm. We define and construct key-binding deterministic tags for signature linkability, that also enable succinct aggregation with approximate lower bound arguments of knowledge; this allows us to achieve succinct aggregation of our signatures without SNARKs. Finally, we extend our threshold ring signatures to realize post-quantum anonymous ledger transactions in the spirit of Monero. Our constructions assume symmetric key primitives only. Whilst it is common to build post-quantum signatures from the one-wayness property of AES and a post-quantum NIZK scheme, we extend this paradigm to define and construct novel security properties from AES that are useful for advanced signature applications. We introduce key-binding and pseudorandomness of AES to establish linkability and anonymity of our threshold ring signatures from deterministic tags, and similarly establish binding and hiding properties of block ciphers modeled as ideal permutations to build commitments from AES, a crucial building block for our proposed post-quantum anonymous ledger scheme.</p>

		<p>On most computers, there’s the feeling that there’s a one-to-one relationship between you and your operating system. You want to do a task, your operating system makes it possible by opening a window and launching an application. In IT, that balance doesn’t exist. Hundreds and thousands of tasks are required at any given moment. It’s up to the operating system to manage it, and it’s your job to manage the operating system. Amazingly, with the emergence of cloud computing, IT infrastructure is subject to even more demands than before. The operating system you choose essentially become</p>

		<p>Last week, I had the delightful experience of reviewing the rough cuts of <em>The Phoenix Project Graphic Novel</em>, Volume 2. It resurrected so many memories from working on the original book nearly 15 years ago. (The first working drafts that George Spafford and I worked on together were from 2005, so that’s 20 years ago!)</p>
<p>In Volume 2 of the graphic novel, which comes out later this year, there are many scenes with Bill and his wife and kids. These scenes were originally written around 2011, right after I left Tripwire. Seeing those blissful scenes of Bill and his young children brings back so many memories!</p>

		<p>Red Hat recently released an integration with PagerDuty, allowing events detected by Insights and the Hybrid Cloud Console (aka the console) to be sent from the console to PagerDuty. From the docs: “When an issue in the Hybrid Cloud Console is detected, PagerDuty automatically notifies the appropriate team members through phone calls, SMS, emails, or push notifications. PagerDuty uses scheduling to ensure team members are alerted only during their designated times. You can create escalation policies to escalate an issue to another team member if the first on-call team member does not respon</p>
