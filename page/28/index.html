<p>If you’re like most makers, you have a few product ideas kicking about, but you may not have made it all the way to production of those things. If you’re thinking about making the leap, [Simone Giertz] recently discussed all the perils and pitfalls of the process from idea to reality.</p>

		<p>A California man has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his involvement in a fraudulent scheme that saw over 50 individuals and organisations lose millions of dollars. 59-year-old Allen Giltman, of Irvine, California, pleaded guilty to charges that he and his co-conspirators built a network of fraudulent websites impersonating legitimate financial institutions. According to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) press release, between 2012 and October 2020, Giltman and others created a series of at least 150 bogus websites that posed as real financial institutions. Websites like&hellip;</p>

	<b><time>06.02.2025 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		<p>When it comes to endpoint detection and response (EDR) compatibility within an MDR offering, managed service providers (MSPs) are weighing two key priorities: native EDR integration or the flexibility to support multiple solutions. According to a recent OpenText survey, opinions are split almost evenly. While 52% of MSPs view native compatibility as moderately or very important, 48% place greater value on flexibility.</p>
<p>This divide reflects the unique demands MSPs face. On one hand, native compatibility ensures a tight integration. On the other, the ability to work seamlessly with various EDR tools is critical for MSPs managing diverse client environments. For MSPs managing a mix of EDR tools across their customer base, this adaptability can be the difference between a smooth operation and a logistical headache.</p>

<p>Microsoft has started testing a new “scareware blocker” feature for the Edge web browser on Windows PCs, which uses machine learning (ML) to detect tech support scams.</p>
<p>Scareware scams (also known as tech support scams) have been a pervasive threat for years. The scammers use aggressive landing pages to persuade potential victims that their devices have been compromised with malware and then try to gain remote access to targets’ systems by pressuring them to call a fake tech support number.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Multi-Authority Functional Encryption with Bounded Collusions from Standard Assumptions</strong><br>
<em>Rishab Goyal, Saikumar Yadugiri</em></p>
<p>Multi-Authority Functional Encryption ($mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$) [Chase, TCC'07; Lewko-Waters, Eurocrypt'11; Brakerski et al., ITCS'17] is a popular generalization of functional encryption ($mathsf{FE}$) with the central goal of decentralizing the trust assumption from a single central trusted key authority to a group of multiple, independent and non-interacting, key authorities. Over the last several decades, we have seen tremendous advances in new designs and constructions for $mathsf{FE}$ supporting different function classes, from a variety of assumptions and with varying levels of security. Unfortunately, the same has not been replicated in the multi-authority setting. The current scope of $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ designs is rather limited, with positive results only known for (all-or-nothing) attribute-based functionalities, or need full power of general-purpose code obfuscation. This state-of-the-art in $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ could be explained in part by the implication provided by Brakerski et al. (ITCS'17). It was shown that a general-purpose obfuscation scheme can be designed from any $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ scheme for circuits, even if the $mathsf{MA}$-$mathsf{FE}$ scheme is secure only in a bounded-collusion model, where at most two keys per authority get corrupted.</p>
