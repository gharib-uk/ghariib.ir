		<p>ComfyUI tips to improve workflow and productivity, even for the beginner.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve been using ComfyUI for a while, you’re bound to discover something that seems simple in hindsight, but you just never noticed. I’ve been using ComfyUI for almost two years now, and I still remember how overwhelming it was to open someone else’s workflow — dozens of nodes, hundreds of parameters, and all that spaghetti everywhere.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Jargon can be defined as <strong>specialized</strong> terminology and language specific to a particular field or profession.</p>
<p>However, the fact that technical writers are tasked with ensuring that the information is accurate and understandable makes jargon a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>This means that when used correctly, it enhances clarity and precision, but when misused, it can confuse and alienate the audience.</p>

<p>As implied above, jargon is sometimes good and can have some benefits when used correctly. In the following sections, we will explore some of it.</p>

<em>Otto Hanyecz, Alexander Karenin, Elena Kirshanova, Péter Kutas, Sina Schaeffler</em></p>
<p>In this paper we propose a constant time lattice reduction algorithm for integral dimension-4 lattices. Motivated by its application in the SQIsign post-quantum signature scheme, we provide for the first time a constant time LLL-like algorithm with guarantees on the length of the shortest output vector. We implemented our algorithm and ensured through various tools that it indeed operates in constant time. Our experiments suggest that in practice our implementation outputs a Minkowski reduced basis and thus can replace a non constant time lattice reduction subroutine in SQIsign.</p>

		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Cryptography is Rocket Science: Analysis of BPSec</strong><br>
<em>Benjamin Dowling, Britta Hale, Xisen Tian, Bhagya Wimalasiri</em></p>
<p>Space networking has become an increasing area of development with the advent of commercial satellite networks such as those hosted by Starlink and Kuiper, and increased satellite and space presence by governments around the world. Yet, historically such network designs have not been made public, leading to limited formal cryptographic analysis of the security offered by them. One of the few public protocols used in space networking is the Bundle Protocol, which is secured by Bundle Protocol Security (BPSec), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard. We undertake a first analysis of BPSec under its default security context, building a model of the secure channel security goals stated in the IETF standard, and note issues therein with message loss detection. We prove BPSec secure, and also provide a stronger construction, one that supports the Bundle Protocol&rsquo;s functionality goals while also ensuring destination awareness of missing message components.</p>

		<p>AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer simplifies inspecting unused access to guide you towards least privilege. You can use unused access findings to identify over-permissive access granted to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and users in your accounts or organization. From a delegated administrator account for IAM Access Analyzer, you can use the dashboard to review unused access findings across your organization and prioritize the accounts to inspect based on the volume and type of findings. The findings highlight unused roles, unused access keys for IAM users, and unused passwords for IAM users. For active IAM users and roles, the findings provide visibility into unused services and actions. Recently, IAM Access Analyzer launched new configuration capabilities that you can use to customize the analysis. You can select accounts, roles, and users to exclude, and focus on the areas that matter the most to you. You can use identifiers such as account ID or scale configuration using tags. By scoping the IAM Access Analyzer to monitor a subset of accounts and roles, you can reduce noise from unwanted findings. You can update the configuration when needed to change the scope of analysis. With this new offering, IAM Access Analyzer provides enhanced controls to help you tailor the analysis more closely to your organization’s security needs.</p>

<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 8, 2025, 5:15 a.m. | 4 hours, 35 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The WordPress Webinar Plugin – WebinarPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file creation due to a missing capability check on the &lsquo;sync-import-imgs&rsquo; function and missing file type validation in all versions up to, and including, 1.33.24. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to create arbitrary files that can lead to remote code execution.<br>
<strong>Severity:</strong> 8.8 | HIGH<br>

		<p><strong>CVE ID :</strong> CVE-2024-11350<br>
<strong>Published :</strong> Jan. 8, 2025, 9:15 a.m. | 35 minutes ago<br>
<strong>Description :</strong> The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation via account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.6. This is due to the plugin not properly validating a user&rsquo;s identity prior to updating their password through the adforest_reset_password() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change arbitrary user&rsquo;s passwords, including administrators, and leverage that to gain access to their account.<br>

<strong>Description :</strong> The WordPress File Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution, Arbitrary File Read, and Arbitrary File Deletion in all versions up to, and including, 4.24.15 via the &lsquo;wfu_file_downloader.php&rsquo; file. This is due to lack of proper sanitization of the &lsquo;source&rsquo; parameter and allowing a user-defined directory path. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.<br>
