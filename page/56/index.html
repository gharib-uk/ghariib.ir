		<p>Kaspersky Secure Mail Gateway now checks links hidden in QR codes – including ones in PDF files.</p>
<p>In an attempt to bypass security solutions, attackers are increasingly hiding phishing and other malicious links inside QR codes. It’s for this reason that we’ve added a technology to Kaspersky Secure Mail Gateway that reads QR codes (including ones hidden inside PDF files), extracts links and checks them before they land in an employee’s inbox. We explain how it works.</p>

		<p>President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order renaming the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge after Jocelyn Nungaray, a Houston girl whose tragic murder at the hands of two unauthorized Venezuelan immigrants, captured national attention. The decision, while framed as an honor to the young victim, raised eyebrows. It marked yet another instance in which Trump leveraged symbolic renaming as a political tool. Previously, in a move that defied geography, diplomacy, and common sense, President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming a section of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” </p>

_Sausalito, Calif. – Mar. 13, 2025</p>
<p>In Apr. 2019, Kristi Noem, Governor of South Dakota at the time, and now U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), wrote that “the cost of cyberattacks is climbing, and the vulnerability of businesses to attacks is on the rise,” and that “by 2021, there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs around the world, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.”</p>

		<p>The Verizon 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report made a startling revelation: Basic Web Application Attacks accounted for nearly one-fourth of the entire breach data set. Although not the most sophisticated threats, common web attacks like credential stuffing and SQL injection continue to wreak havoc on the cybersecurity landscape—just like phishing and emerging AI-based attacks—and for good reason. According to the DBIR, weak passwords are the main culprit for the success of these low-level attacks. This should come as no surprise: a study by Keeper indicates that three out of four people&hellip;</p>
