		<p>ePrint Report: <strong>Black-Box Registered ABE from Lattices</strong><br>
<em>Ziqi Zhu, Kai Zhang, Zhili Chen, Junqing Gong, Haifeng Qian</em></p>
<p>This paper presents the first black-box registered ABE for circuit from lattices. The selective security is based on evasive LWE assumption [EUROCRYPT'22, CRYPTO'22]. The unique prior Reg-ABE scheme from lattices is derived from non-black-box construction based on function-binding hash and witness encryption [CRYPTO'23]. Technically, we first extend the black-box registration-based encryption from standard LWE [CRYPTO'23] so that we can register a public key with a function; this yields a LWE-based Reg-ABE with ciphertexts of size $L cdot mathsf{polylog}(L)$ where $L$ is the number of users. We then make use of the special structure of its ciphertext to reduce its size to $mathsf{polylog}(L)$ via an algebraic obfuscator based on evasive LWE [CRYPTO'24].</p>

		<p>As a rule, book reviews are not a thing I usually do.</p>
<p>So when I received an out-of-the-blue email from Cory Doctorow last week asking if I would review his latest book, Red Team Blues, it took a minute to overcome my initial skepticism. While I’m a fan of Cory’s work, this is a narrow/nerdy blog about cryptography, not a place where we spend much time on literature. Moreover, my only previous attempt to review a popular cryptography novel — a quick sketch of Dan Brown’s abysmal <em>Digital Fortress</em> — did not go very well for anyone.</p>

		<p>The next BSides København will take place on 9 November 2024. There is one presentation in the schedule about the use of metrics in information security. Computers allow us to create documents, charts, and statistical values easily from any data collection we like. Therefore, the World Wide Web is full of graphs, tables with numbers, predictions, and all kinds of results. The problem is that not everything you can count is a suitable metric tied to real-life observations. Finding a metric is a science on its own. This presentation will give you some examples of how to measure meaningful attributes of computer systems and networks. You will also get to know the term metric more closely. Using proper metrics and assessing customer-provided reports will help you immensely when dealing with information security decisions. The</p>

<p>Upon loading the screen, we are presented with a file upload and a button to make a jpeg icon. We also note that the version string indicates it was made in 2016, with a version of <code>Version 2016.3717</code>. After playing around with it for a little while, I thought about how there was that ImageMagick bug last year that let you execute code remotely. I wasn’t sure it would work, but it was worth a shot.</p>

		<p>In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application using LlamaIndex, an innovative framework to help you build large language model (LLM) powered applications. By the end of this guide, you will have a clear understanding of the components involved and a hands-on demo that will help you implement your own RAG application.</p>

	<div>
		<p>To achieve success and rise above competitors in 2025, organizations must focus on building high-performance teams. One strategy to do this is to empower small, long-lived teams as the fundamental building blocks of your organization’s design. </p>
<p>As we looked at in the previous blog in our series on high-performing teams, building high-performance teams has less to do with where your teams sit and more with how you build the social circuitry between and within teams. The <em>Team Topologies</em> approach provides a proven framework for designing and evolving these teams to maximize flow and adaptability.</p>
