		<p>CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2024-3393 Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Malformed DNS Packet Vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.</p>
