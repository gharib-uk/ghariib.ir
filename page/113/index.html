<h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>A typical Java or Kotlin programmer spends most of their productive time either creating application code in an editor or searching for bugs in a debugger. Occasionally, they might dive into a profiler when looking for places where the application spends too much time. However, they almost never venture into the Java C1 or C2 compilers and their resulting products – low-level assembly code. For the most part, the Java compilers are black boxes that typically remain closed under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. In this ‘behind closed doors’ talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.</p>
<p>Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.</p>

<p>Smartphones, smart homes, and virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri have seamlessly integrated into our daily lives. Yet, many of us rarely stop to think about the technology behind them. We enjoy the convenience these devices offer, but behind the scenes, artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way we live, work, and interact with the world.</p>
<p>At first glance, AI-related terms like machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing might seem complex and almost like learning a new language. However, as AI becomes more common, understanding these concepts is becoming essential. But what exactly is AI, and how is it making an impact?</p>

<p>Lumma Stealer, nefarious info-stealing malware, resurfaces in the cyber threat arena. Defenders recently uncovered an advanced adversary campaign distributing Lumma Stealer through GitHub infrastructure along with other malware variants, including SectopRAT, Vidar, and Cobeacon.</p>
<h2 id="detect-lumma-stealer-sectoprat-vidar-cobeacon-deployed-via-github">Detect Lumma Stealer, SectopRAT, Vidar, Cobeacon Deployed via GitHub</h2>
<p>Lumma Stealer is a notorious data-stealing malware that extracts credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, system details, and files while connecting to adversary servers to enable further malicious actions. The latest campaign associated with Lumma Stealer’s GitHub-based delivery poses a growing threat to potentially affected organizations and individual users due to a set of sophisticated evasion techniques and offensive capabilities involving the deployment of other malware, such as SectopRAT, Vidar, and Cobeacon. </p>

		<p>A critical cybersecurity vulnerability has been uncovered in Contec CMS8000 patient monitors, revealing embedded malware that poses significant risks to patient safety and data security.</p>
<p>The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reported that the devices include a backdoor linked to a hard-coded IP address associated with a Chinese university.</p>
<p>The Contec CMS8000 patient monitor, widely used in hospitals and healthcare facilities, was found to have three major vulnerabilities.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Just days after we uncovered a campaign targeting Google Ads accounts, a similar attack has surfaced, this time aimed at Microsoft advertisers. These malicious ads, appearing on Google Search, are designed to steal the login information of users trying to access Microsoft’s advertising platform.</p>
<p>Microsoft does purchase ad space on its rival’s dominant search engine; however, we found Google sponsored results for “Microsoft Ads” (formerly known as Bing Ads) that contained malicious links created by impostors.</p>

		<p>We hardly knew ye.</p>
<p>Every so often, Microsoft will remove a pretty useful feature from one of its apps. Sometimes, they evaporate for seemingly no reason, and sometimes, the feature just wasn&rsquo;t seeing enough use to justify continuing its support. Today, we&rsquo;re seeing an example of the latter case: Microsoft has announced that it&rsquo;s sunsetting the Microsoft Defender VPN feature at the end of February. It&rsquo;s a move that&rsquo;s bound to prompt a lot of questions, including &ldquo;When on Earth did Microsoft Defender get a VPN feature?&rdquo;</p>
