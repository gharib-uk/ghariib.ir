<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This blog post presents an in-depth exploration of Microsoft&rsquo;s Time Travel Debugging (TTD) framework, a powerful record-and-replay debugging framework for Windows user-mode applications. TTD relies heavily on accurate CPU instruction emulation to faithfully replay program executions. However, subtle inaccuracies within this emulation process can lead to significant security and reliability issues, potentially masking vulnerabilities or misleading critical investigations—particularly incident response and malware analysis. This could cause analysts to overlook threats or draw incorrect conclusions. Furthermore, attackers can exploit these inaccuracies to intentionally evade detection or disrupt forensic analyses, severely compromising investigative outcomes. </p>
