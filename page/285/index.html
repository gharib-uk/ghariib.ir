	<div>
		<p>Software architecture plays a pivotal role in the success of any application. Among the most frequently discussed architectural models are monoliths, modular monoliths, and microservices. Choosing the right model depends on factors such as system complexity, scalability requirements, and maintenance considerations. In this article, we gonna view a quick introduction of each concept with some examples.</p>
<h2 id="monolith">Monolith</h2>
<p>The monolith is the most traditional architectural model, where the entire application is built as a single unit. All components (interface, business logic, and database) are integrated and interact directly within the same project.</p>

<p>As we look back on the cybersecurity landscape of 2024, it’s clear that the world of digital threats continues to evolve at an alarming pace in parallel with AI. This year has seen ransomware groups adapt and innovate, pushing the boundaries of their malicious capabilities and evasiveness from law enforcement. In our annual “Nastiest Malware” report, now in its sixth year, we’ve observed a steady increase in both the number and sophistication of malware attacks. The ransomware sector, in particular, has witnessed the emergence of “business models,” with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) dominating the scene. Elite ransomware authors have concluded that profit sharing and risk mitigation are key contributors to their consistent success and evasion of authorities.</p>

		<p>The next generation of Intel mobile processors has finally arrived.</p>
<p>Intel launched numerous new Arrow Lake mobile processors at CES 2025 to round out its portfolio of low-power CPUs. With the 200V series already available, the company focused on new Core Ultra 200HX, 200H, and 200U processors at this year&rsquo;s event. Intel is offering some serious performance with some of these SKUs, including the flagship Core Ultra 9 285HX and its impressive 24 cores.</p>

		<p>In the recent codecov.io security incident, an attacker modified a shell script used by a common software development tool for code coverage. This modification did not take place at the original source code repository where it would have been visible to others, but after the code was packaged and placed on the web server from which it was served.</p>
<p>Prompted by this incident, we are now releasing new tools that provide information and detection of similar attacks against other projects. The scope is limited to attacks that modify the released code and do not touch the original source code. The following tools are now available:</p>
