				<p>In early December 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence detected a large-scale malvertising campaign that impacted nearly one million devices globally in an opportunistic attack to steal information. The attack originated from illegal streaming websites embedded with malvertising redirectors, leading to an intermediary website where the user was then redirected to GitHub and two other platforms. The campaign impacted a wide range of organizations and industries, including both consumer and enterprise devices, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of the attack.</p>
<p>Learn more about this malvertising campaign&rsquo;s multi-stage attack chain</p>
<p>Listen to the Microsoft Threat Intelligence podcast</p>
<p>GitHub was the primary platform used in the delivery of the initial access payloads and is referenced throughout this blog post; however, Microsoft Threat Intelligence also observed one payload hosted on Discord and another hosted on Dropbox.</p>
<p>The GitHub repositories, which were taken down, stored malware used to deploy additional malicious files and scripts. Once the initial malware from GitHub gained a foothold on the device, the additional files deployed had a modular and multi-stage approach to payload delivery, execution, and persistence. The files were used to collect system information and to set up further malware and scripts to exfiltrate documents and data from the compromised host. This activity is tracked under the umbrella name Storm-0408 that we use to track numerous threat actors associated with remote access or information-stealing malware and who use phishing, search engine optimization (SEO), or malvertising campaigns to distribute malicious payloads.</p>
<p>In this blog, we provide our analysis of this large-scale malvertising campaign, detailing our findings regarding the redirection chain and various payloads used across the multi-stage attack chain. We further provide recommendations for mitigating the impact of this threat, detection details, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and hunting guidance to locate related activity. By sharing this research, we aim to raise awareness about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in this widespread activity so organizations can better prepare and implement effective mitigation strategies to protect their systems and data.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the GitHub security team for their prompt response and collaboration in taking down the malicious repositories.</p>
<h2 id="github-activity-and-redirection-chain">GitHub activity and redirection chain</h2>
<p>Since at least early December 2024, multiple hosts downloaded first-stage payloads from malicious GitHub repositories. The users were redirected to GitHub through a series of other redirections. Analysis of the redirector chain determined the attack likely originated from illegal streaming websites where users can watch pirated videos. The streaming websites embedded malvertising redirectors within movie frames to generate pay-per-view or pay-per-click revenue from malvertising platforms. These redirectors subsequently routed traffic through one or two additional malicious redirectors, ultimately leading to another website, such as a malware or tech support scam website, which then redirected to GitHub.</p>
<p>Multiple stages of malware were deployed in this campaign, as listed below, and the several different stages of activity that occurred depended on the payload dropped during the second stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first-stage payload that was hosted on GitHub served as the dropper for the next stage of payloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second-stage files were used to conduct system discovery and to exfiltrate system information that was Base64-encoded into the URL and sent over HTTP to an IP address. The information collected included data on memory size, graphic details, screen resolution, operating system (OS), and user paths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various third-stage payloads were deployed depending on the second-stage payload. In general, the third-stage payload conducted additional malicious activities such as command and control (C2) to download additional files and to exfiltrate data, as well as defense evasion techniques.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The full redirect chain was composed of four to five layers. Microsoft researchers determined malvertising redirectors were contained within an iframe on illegal streaming websites.</p>

<h2 id="attack-chain">Attack chain</h2>
<p>Once the redirection to GitHub occurred, the malware hosted on GitHub established the initial foothold on the user’s device and functioned as a dropper for additional payload stages and running malicious code. The additional payloads included information stealers to collect system and browser information on the compromised device, of which most were either Lumma stealer or an updated version of Doenerium. Depending on the initial payload, the deployment of NetSupport, a remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, was also often deployed alongside the infostealer. Besides the information stealers, PowerShell, JavaScript, VBScript, and AutoIT scripts were run on the host. The threat actors incorporated use of living-off-the-land binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) like <em>PowerShell.exe</em>, <em>MSBuild.exe</em>_,_ and <em>RegAsm.exe</em> for C2 and data exfiltration of user data and browser credentials.</p>
<p>After the initial foothold was gained, the activity led to a modular and multi-stage approach to payload delivery, execution, and persistence. Each stage dropped another payload with a different function, as outlined below. Actions conducted across these stages include system discovery (memory, GPU, OS, signed-in users, and others), opening browser credential files, Data Protection API (DPAPI) crypt data calls, and other functions such as obfuscated script execution and named pipe creations to conduct data exfiltration. Persistence was achieved through modification of the registry run keys and the addition of a shortcut file to the Windows <em>Startup</em> folder.</p>
<p>Several stages of malicious activity to conduct deployment of additional malware, collections, and exfiltration of data to a C2 were observed. While not every single initial payload followed these exact steps, this is an overall view of what occurred across most incidents analyzed:</p>

The first stage involves the malvertising website redirecting users to GitHub pages, leading to a payload downloading from the repo. In the second stage, the payload performs system discovery and exfiltrates collected system information and stage-two payloads drop additional payloads. In the third stage, if the payload is a PowerShell script, it downloads NetSupport RAT from C2, sets persistence, and it may deliver a Lumma Stealer payload using MSBuild.exe for exfiltration. If the third stage payload is an .exe, it creates and runs a .cmd file and drops renamed AutoIT interpreter with a .com file extension, leading to the fourth stage. In the final stage, AutoIT launches binary and may drop an AutoIT interpreter with .scr file extensions, where a JavaScript file is dropped for running and persistence of those files. Finally, the AutoIT payload uses RegAsm.exe or PowerShell.exe to open files, enable browser remote debugging, and exfiltrate data. PowerShell may be deployed to set exclusion paths for Defender and/or drop NetSupport." />

<h3 id="first-stage-payload-establishing-a-foothold-on-the-host">First-stage payload: Establishing a foothold on the host</h3>
<p>During the first stage, a payload is dropped onto the user’s device from the binary hosted on GitHub, establishing a foothold on that device. As of mid-January 2025, the first-stage payloads discovered were digitally signed with a newly created certificate. A total of twelve different certificates were identified, all of which have been revoked.</p>
<p>Most of these initial payloads dropped the following legitimate files to leverage their functionality. These files were either leveraged by the first-stage payload or by later-stage payloads, depending on the actions being conducted.</p>

<p>Depending on the first-stage payload that was initially established on the compromised device, Microsoft observed different second-stage payloads and several different methods for delivering these payloads to the device.</p>
<h3 id="second-stage-payload-system-discovery-collection-and-exfiltration">Second-stage payload: System discovery, collection, and exfiltration</h3>
<p>The main purpose of the second-stage payload is to conduct system discovery and collect that data for exfiltration to the C2. The system information collected includes data such as memory size, graphic card details, screen resolution, operating system, user paths, and a reference to the second-stage payload’s file name.</p>
<p>This was accomplished by querying the registry key <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionProductName</em> for the Windows OS version and running commands, such as the <em>echo</em> command, to gather the device’s name (<em>%COMPUTERNAME%)</em> and domain name (<em>%USERDOMAIN%).</em></p>
<p>System data collected by the second-stage payload is Base64-encoded and exfiltrated as a query parameter to an IP address.</p>

<h3 id="third-stage-payload-powershell-and-exe-binary">Third-stage payload: PowerShell and <em>.exe</em> binary</h3>
<p>Depending on the second-stage payload, either one or multiple executables are dropped onto the compromised device, and sometimes an accompanying encoded PowerShell script. These files initiate a chain of events that conduct command execution, payload delivery, defensive evasion, persistence, C2 communications, and data exfiltration. The analysis of the dropped executables is first discussed below, followed by review of the PowerShell scripts observed.</p>
<h4 id="third-stage-exe-analysis">Third-stage .exe analysis</h4>
<p>The second-stage payloads run the dropped third-stage executables using the command prompt (for example, <em>cmd.exe  /d /s /c “”C:Users<!-- raw HTML omitted -->AppDataLocalTempApproachAllan.exe””</em>). The <em>/c</em> flag ensures that the command runs and exits quickly. When the third-stage <em>.exe</em> runs, it drops a command file (.<em>cmd</em>) and launches it using the command prompt (for example, “<em>cmd.exe” /c copy Beauty Beauty.cmd &amp;&amp; Beauty.cmd</em>). The <em>.cmd</em> file performs several actions, such as running <em>tasklist</em>, to initiate the discovery of running programs. This is followed by the <em>findstr</em> to search for keywords associated with security software:</p>

<p>The <em>.cmd</em> file also concatenates multiple files into one with a single character file name: <em>“cmd /c copy /b ..Verzeichnis + ..Controlling + ..Constitute + ..Enjoyed + ..Confusion + ..Min +..Statutory J”</em>. This single character filename is used next.</p>
<p>Following this, the third-stage <em>.exe</em> produces an AutoIT v3 interpreter file that is renamed from the typical file name of <em>AutoIt3.exe</em> and uses a <em>.com</em> file extension. The <em>.cmd</em> file initiates the execution of the <em>.com</em> file against the single character binary (such as <em>Briefly.com J</em>). Note, most of the second-stage payloads follow this progression chain, and as mentioned a second-stage payload can also drop multiple executables, all following the same process. For example:</p>
<p><strong>First stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>X-essentiApp.exe</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ionixnignx.exe</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>EverybodyViewing.exe</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ReliefOrganizational.exe</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>InflationWinston.exe</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third-stage command files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Beauty.cmd</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Possess.cmd</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Villa.cmd</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fourth-stage AutoIT <em>.com</em> files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Alexandria.com</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kills.com</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Briefly.com</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We observed multiple <em>.com</em> files originating from different dropped executables, each performing distinct functions while occasionally overlapping in behavior. These files facilitate persistence, process injection, remote debugging, and data exfiltration through various mechanisms. One <em>.com</em> file, such as <em>Alexandria.com</em>, drops a <em>.scr</em> file (another renamed AutoIT interpreter), and a <em>.js</em> (JavaScript) file with the same name as the <em>.scr</em> file. The purpose of the JavaScript file is to ensure persistence by creating a <em>.url</em> internet shortcut that points to the JavaScript file and is placed in the <em>Startup</em> folder, ensuring that the <em>.scr</em> file executes when the <em>.js</em> file executes (through <em>Wscript.exe</em>) upon user sign-in. Alternatively, persistence can be achieved using scheduled task creation. The <em>.scr</em> file can initiate C2 connections, enable remote debugging on Chrome or Edge within a hidden desktop session, or create TCP listening sockets on ports 9220-9229. This functionality allows threat actors to monitor browsing activity and interact with an active browser instance. These files can also open sensitive data files, indicating their role in facilitating post-exploitation activities.</p>
<p>Another _._<em>com</em> file, such as <em>affiliated.com</em>, also focuses on remote debugging and browser monitoring. In addition to remote monitoring, <em>affiliated.com</em> initiates network connections to Telegram, Let’s Encrypt, and threat actor domains, potentially for C2 or exfiltration. It also accesses DPAPI to decrypt sensitive stored credentials and retrieve browser data.</p>
<p>The final observed _._<em>com</em> file, such as <em>Briefly.com</em>, exhibits behavior similar to <em>affiliated.com</em> but extends its capabilities to include screenshot capture, data exfiltration, and PowerShell-based execution. This file accesses browser and user data for collection, establishes connections to Pastebin and additional C2 domains, and drops the fourth-stage PowerShell script.</p>
<p>The order in which these _._<em>com</em> files run is not strictly defined, as one or multiple files can perform overlapping functions depending on the third-stage payload. In many cases, the _._<em>com</em> files also leverage LOLBAS like <em>RegAsm.exe</em> by dropping a legitimate file into the <em>%TEMP%</em> directory or injecting malicious code into it using <em>NtAllocateVirtualMemory</em> and <em>SetThreadContext</em> API function calls. <em>RegAsm.exe</em> is used to establish C2 connections over TCP ports 15647 or 9000, exfiltrating data, accessing DPAPI for decryption, monitoring keystrokes using the <em>WH_KEYBOARD_LL</em> hook, and more. This flexibility in execution allows threat actors to tailor their approach based on environmental factors, such as security configurations and user activity.</p>

<h4 id="third-stage-powershell-analysis">Third-stage PowerShell analysis</h4>
<p>If a PowerShell script is also dropped by the second-stage payload, it includes Base64-obfuscated commands to conduct actions, such as use <em>curl</em> to download additional files like NetSupport from the C2, create persistence for the NetSupport RAT, and exfiltrate system information to C2 servers. To ensure no errors or the progress meter is displayed on the compromised device, the <em>curl</em> command is often used with the <em>–silent</em> option when downloading files from the C2. PowerShell is often configured to run without restrictions with the <em>-ExecutionPolicy Bypass</em> parameter.</p>
<p>As an example, in some of the incidents, when the second-stage payload runs, a PowerShell script is dropped and executed. The script sends the compromised device’s name to the C2 and downloads NetSupport RAT from the same C2.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Second-stage payload: <em>Squarel.exe</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PowerShell script: SHA-256: d70ccae7914fc8c36c9e11b2a7f10bebd7f5696e78d8836554f4990b0f688dbb</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C2 domain: <em>keikochio[.]com</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NetSupport RAT: SHA-256: 32a828e2060e92b799829a12e3e87730e9a88ecfa65a4fc4700bdcc57a52d995</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In another case, a second-stage payload drops a PowerShell script, which connects to <em>hxxps://ipinfo[.]io</em> to gather the compromised device’s external-facing IP address. This information is sent to a Telegram chat, then drops <em>presentationhost.exe</em> (a renamed NetSupport binary) and <em>remcmdstub.exe</em> (NetSupport Command Manager) into the <em>%TEMP%</em> directory. Finally, the PowerShell script establishes persistence for <em>presentationhost.exe</em> by adding it to the auto-start extensibility points (ASEP) registry keys. When it runs, the NetSupport RAT connects to the C2 and captures a screenshot of the compromised device’s desktop. It also delivers a Lumma executable that drops a VBScript file with the same name. The VBScript file runs encoded PowerShell to initiate C2 connections and launches <em>MSBuild.exe</em> to enable Chrome remote debugging on a hidden desktop. Additionally, <em>presentationhost.exe</em> initiates <em>remcmdstub.exe</em>, which leverages <em>iScrPaint.exe</em> (iTop Screen Recorder) to run <em>MSBuild.exe</em> and access browser credential files for exfiltration. The <em>iScrPaint.exe</em> file also establishes persistence by placing a .<em>lnk</em> shortcut in the Windows <em>Startup</em> folder, ensuring it runs on system reboot.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Second-stage payload: <em>Application.exe</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PowerShell script: SHA-256: 483796a64f004a684a7bc20c1ddd5c671b41a808bc77634112e1703052666a64</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C2: <em>hxxp:</em>//<em>5</em>_.10.250[.]240/fakeurl.htm_</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last observed third-stage PowerShell script was dropped by three second-stage payloads. The script sends the compromised device’s name to the C2 server. It then changes the working directory to <em>$env:APPDATA</em>, before using <em>Start-BitsTransfer</em> to download NetSupport from the C2. To evade detection, it modifies system security settings forcing TLS1.2 for encrypted C2 communication. These files are extracted into a newly created <em>WinLibraryClient</em> directory under <em>AppData</em> and then are launched. The script establishes persistence for the <em>client32.exe (<em>NetSupport RAT</em>)</em> by modifying the ASEP registry. <em>Client32.exe</em> initiates C2 connections to <em>hxxp://79.132.128[.]77/fakeurl.htm</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Second-stage payloads: <em>SalmonSamurai.exe</em>, <em>LakerBaker.exe</em>, and <em>DisplayPhotoViewer.exe</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PowerShell script: SHA-256: 670218cfc5c16d06762b6bc74cda4902087d812e72c52d6b9077c4c4164856b6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C2 domain: <em>stocktemplates[.]net</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, one observed execution included registry enumeration of <em>HKCU:SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall</em> to identify installed applications and security software. It also queries the system’s domain status using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and scans for cryptocurrency wallets, including Ledger Live, Trezor Suite, KeepKey, BCVault, OneKey, and BitBox, indicating potential financial data theft.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-stage-powershell-analysis">Fourth-stage PowerShell analysis</h3>
<p>Depending on the <em>.com</em> file that ran (like <em>Briefly.com</em>), the renamed AutoIT file may drop a PowerShell script (SHA-256: 2a29c9904d1860ea3177da7553c8b1bf1944566e5bc1e71340d9e0ff079f0bd3). The obfuscated PowerShell code uses the <em>Add-MpPreference</em> cmdlet to modify Microsoft Defender to add in exclusion paths for Microsoft Defender, so the specified folders are not scanned.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.</p>
<h3 id="strengthen-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-configuration">Strengthen Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that tamper protection is enabled in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable network protection in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn on web protection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure investigation and remediation in full automated mode to let Microsoft Defender for Endpoint take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft Defender XDR customers can turn on the following attack surface reduction rules to prevent common attack techniques used by threat actors. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block use of copied or impersonated system tools</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strengthen-operating-environment-configuration">Strengthen operating environment configuration</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Require multifactor authentication (MFA). While certain attacks such as adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attempt to circumvent MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a variety of threats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage phishing-resistant authentication methods such as FIDO Tokens, or Microsoft Authenticator with passkey. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid risks associated with SIM-jacking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement Entra ID Conditional Access authentication strength to require phishing-resistant authentication for employees and external users for critical apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Service connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection to block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AppLocker can restrict specific software tools prohibited within the organization, such as reconnaissance, fingerprinting, and RMM tools, or grant access to only specific users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
