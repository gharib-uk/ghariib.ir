				<p>We are excited to announce the release of a new capability in Bitbucket Pipelines that will improve your experience diagnosing issues with your pipeline runs, by allowing you to view and access previous runs within the Pipelines UI.</p>

<p>The previous pipeline <strong>Runs</strong> dropdown will not show up if you re-run an entire pipeline, because re-running an entire pipeline creates an entirely separate pipeline record, rather than an additional run on an existing pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h2>
<p>The ability to view previous pipeline runs provides valuable insights into the history of your builds. This feature empowers you to:</p>
<p><strong>Compare Results:</strong> Easily compare the results of different pipeline runs to analyze performance and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Track Progress:</strong> Gain visibility into the status and outcomes of past pipeline runs, allowing you to track progress and identify trends over time.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshoot Issues:</strong> Quickly pinpoint and investigate failed or problematic pipeline runs to diagnose issues and take corrective actions.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>On the Pipeline result page for a specific pipeline, you’ll see the <strong>Runs</strong> dropdown (if there were previous runs for that particular pipeline) that will display a list of these previous runs when selected. Select a run from the list to access and review the information associated with that previous run. The list displays the most recent 10 runs.</p>
<p>We have also added the run number into the URL. So, when you are viewing a previous run, you can easily save and share a link directly to it.</p>
<p>The post Quickly diagnose issues by viewing previous Pipeline runs appeared first on Work Life by Atlassian.</p>
