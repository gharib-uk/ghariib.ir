			<h1>Unveiling Hidden Connections: JA4 Client Fingerprinting on VirusTotal</h1>
			<b><time>05.01.2025 00:00</time></b>
		       

			<div>
				<p>VirusTotal has incorporated a powerful new tool to fight against malware: <strong>JA4 client fingerprinting</strong>. This feature allows security researchers to track and identify malicious files based on the unique characteristics of their TLS client communications.</p>
<h3 id="ja4-a-more-robust-successor-to-ja3">JA4: A More Robust Successor to JA3</h3>
<p>JA4, developed by FoxIO, represents a significant advancement over the older JA3 fingerprinting method. JA3&rsquo;s effectiveness had been hampered by the increasing use of TLS extension randomization in https clients, which made fingerprints less consistent. JA4 was specifically designed to be resilient to this randomization, resulting in more stable and reliable fingerprints.</p>
<h2 id="unveiling-the-secrets-of-the-client-hello">Unveiling the Secrets of the Client Hello</h2>
<p>JA4 fingerprinting focuses on analyzing the TLS Client Hello packet, which is sent unencrypted from the client to the server at the start of a TLS connection. This packet contains a treasure trove of information that can uniquely identify the client application or its underlying TLS library. Some of the key elements extracted by JA4 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TLS Version: The version of TLS supported by the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cipher Suites: The list of cryptographic algorithms the client can use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLS Extensions: Additional features and capabilities supported by the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation): The application-level protocol, such as HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, that the client wants to use after the TLS handshake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ja4-in-action-pivoting-and-hunting-on-virustotal">JA4 in Action: Pivoting and Hunting on VirusTotal</h2>
<p>VirusTotal has integrated JA4 fingerprinting into its platform through the <em>behavior_network</em> file search modifier. This allows analysts to quickly discover relationships between files based on their JA4 fingerprints.</p>
<p>To find the JA4 value, navigate to the &ldquo;behavior&rdquo; section of the desired sample and locate the TLS subsection. In addition to JA4, you might also find JA3 or JA3S there.</p>
<p>Example Search: Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve encountered a suspicious file that exhibits the JA4 fingerprint &ldquo;t10d070600_c50f5591e341_1a3805c3aa63&rdquo; during VirusTotal&rsquo;s behavioral analysis.</p>

</p>
<p>You can click on this JA4 to pivot using the search query behavior_network:t10d070600_c50f5591e341_1a3805c3aa63 finding other files with the same fingerprint This search will pivot you to additional samples that share the same JA4 fingerprint, suggesting they might be related. This could indicate that these files are part of the same malware family or share a common developer or simply share a common TLS library.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<h3 id="wildcard-searches">Wildcard Searches</h3>
<p>To broaden your search, you can use wildcards within the JA4 hash. For instance, the search: behaviour_network:t13d190900_*_97f8aa674fd9</p>
<p>Returns files that match the JA4_A and JA4_C components of the JA4 hash while allowing for variations in the middle section, which often corresponds to the cipher suite. This technique is useful for identifying files that might use different ciphers but share other JA4 characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="yara-hunting-rules-automating-ja4-based-detection">YARA Hunting Rules: Automating JA4-Based Detection</h3>
<p>YARA hunting rules using the &ldquo;vt&rdquo; module can be written to automatically detect files based on their JA4 fingerprints. Here&rsquo;s an example of a YARA rule that targets a specific JA4 fingerprint:</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>This rules will flag any file submitted to VirusTotal that exhibits the matching JA4 fingerprint. The first example only matches &ldquo;t12d190800_d83cc789557e_7af1ed941c26&rdquo; during behavioral analysis. The second rule will match a regular expression /t10d070600_.*_1a3805c3aa63/, only matching JA4_A and JA4_C components, excluding the JA4_B cipher suite. These fingerprints could be linked to known malware, a suspicious application, or any TLS client behavior that is considered risky by security analysts.</p>
