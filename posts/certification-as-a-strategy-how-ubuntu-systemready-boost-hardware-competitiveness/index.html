				<p>Canonical and MediaTek enhance reliability, accelerate market entry and reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for ODMs through Ubuntu Certified Hardware and Arm SystemReady programs </p>
<p>The hardware ecosystem is evolving rapidly, presenting a continuous challenge in ensuring that new hardware is market-ready and meets software and security standards. Forward-looking hardware vendors recognise that certification and compliance to standards ensure product reliability, compatibility, and accelerated time to market </p>
<p>Canonical and MediaTek underscore the essential role of certification and compliance in driving technological innovation and operational excellence. By achieving Ubuntu Certification and Arm’s SystemReady™ compliance, MediaTek has positioned Genio 1200 as a benchmark for industry standards and reliability. This achievement enhances its appeal for ODMs seeking product reliability and reduced TCO. The Advantech RSB-3810, powered by MediaTek Genio 1200 and certified on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, exemplifies the practical benefits of both programs, showing how products can meet rigorous quality and reliability standards to satisfy market demands. </p>

<h2 id="arms-role-in-setting-industry-standards">Arm’s role in setting industry standards</h2>
<p>The Arm SystemReady program helps ensure the interoperability of an operating system on Arm-based hardware. It unites the ecosystem on a common foundation and enables everyone to focus on differentiation and innovation. Developers can build software once and deploy it on any compliant hardware. SystemReady Devicetree targets Devicetree based Linux only distributions on Arm-based systems.  It optimizes install and boot for embedded systems, and includes support for secure firmware over-the-air (OTA) updates and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) secure boot. </p>
<p>“To address new edge AI use cases, there is a growing demand for high-performance, power-efficient IoT devices, making it more important than ever to have standards in place that improve the developer experience, ensure interoperability, reliability and drive innovation,” said Paul Williamson, SVP and GM, IoT Line of Business at Arm. “SystemReady helps the industry to standardize where it matters and provides a reliable framework for Canonical to offer Ubuntu for performance and long term support. MediaTek’s achievement will ensure developers can create better, more secure, AI experiences for end users.”</p>
<p>By setting standard interfaces between the firmware and operating system, SystemReady streamlines the process for achieving Ubuntu certification, which focuses on the broader scope of operating system functionality and overall performance. </p>
<h2 id="ubuntu-certified-hardware-more-than-compliance--a-commitment-to-excellence">Ubuntu Certified Hardware: more than compliance — a commitment to excellence</h2>
<p>Ubuntu certification ensures that devices not only meet performance standards but also excel in functionality, providing the optimal Ubuntu experience right out of the box. This cohesive process benefits ODMs by simplifying solution implementation and reducing development and support costs. Certified devices are thoroughly tested for enhanced reliability and performance. Organisations can combine these benefits with Ubuntu Pro for Devices to get security updates for up to 12  years. The Ubuntu Pro subscription also provides fleet management with Landscape and compliance with established security baselines and standards, ensuring devices meet the high expectations of end customers. </p>
<p>“Our Certified Hardware Programme affirms our commitment to providing unmatched reliability and performance,” stated Olivier Philippe, VP Devices Engineering at Canonical. “Our certification of the MediaTek Genio 1200 and collaboration with Arm open new markets and present state-of-the-art performance/cost ratios to our partners, reinforcing the value of our precise and rigorous integration and testing capabilities.”</p>
<p>MediaTek’s achievement of these certifications establishes its SoC as a premier choice for ODMs seeking to meet and exceed industry standards, ensuring compliance and providing a competitive edge in the market.</p>
<p>“By certifying the MediaTek Genio 1200 for Ubuntu and SystemReady, we are highlighting our commitment to providing the most optimised computing experience for users,” said CK Wang, General Manager of the IoT Business Unit at MediaTek. “This milestone places us at the forefront of the industry and opens new market opportunities, ensuring that our products deliver superior performance and reliability.”</p>
<p>Together, these certifications form a robust foundation that enhances interoperability and ensures optimised performance, clearly defining their complementary roles in advancing the tech industry.</p>
<h2 id="canonicals-partner-programs-driving-value-and-innovation">Canonical’s Partner Programs: driving value and innovation</h2>
<p>Canonical’s partner programs for Independent Hardware Vendors (IHV) and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) enhance the value offered to partners, streamlining product development cycles and market entry. Participation in these programs grants access to certified SoCs and devices, ensuring that partners are building their products using reliable components with software that is continuously updated, and maintained by Canonical. This demonstrates a shared commitment to align our partners’ solutions with the European Cyber Resilience Act (EU CRA) and other global security regulations and standards. </p>
