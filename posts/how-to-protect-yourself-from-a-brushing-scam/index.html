<p>Brushing scams are a type of online fraud where sellers send unsolicited packages to individuals, even though they never made an order. These deceptive tactics are often used on popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and AliExpress. The goal of scammers is to artificially inflate product rankings and create fake reviews, ultimately boosting their sales and visibility. Read on to understand how brushing scams work and what steps you can take to stay safe.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-brushing-scam">What Is a Brushing Scam?</h2>
<p>A brushing scam is a fraudulent practice in which sellers send packages to people without their knowledge or consent. These items are typically cheap and low-quality, such as inexpensive jewelry or random gadgets, and are sent to fake addresses or addresses obtained illegally. Once the item is delivered, the fraudster writes a fake review praising the product, which helps the seller’s rating rise.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-it-called-a-brushing-scam">Why Is It Called a “Brushing” Scam?</h2>
<p>The term “brushing” originates from Chinese e-commerce, where the act of “brushing up” sales numbers involves creating fake orders and sending goods to random individuals. This practice boosts a product’s perceived popularity, tricking other buyers into thinking the product is highly rated, thus increasing its sales.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-brushing-scams-work">How Do Brushing Scams Work?</h2>
<p>Here’s how a brushing scam typically unfolds:</p>
<ul>
<li>The scammer creates a fake account on an e-commerce platform.</li>
<li>They place an order for their own product using an address they’ve obtained illegitimately.</li>
<li>A cheap product, such as a low-quality ring or fake electronic device, is sent to the recipient.</li>
<li>Once the package arrives, the scammer posts a glowing review under their fake account to make the product appear more legitimate.</li>
</ul>
<p>These scammers often send products like costume jewelry, seeds, or inexpensive gadgets to inflate their reviews and rankings. If you find an unsolicited package at your door, there’s a high chance it’s part of a brushing scam.</p>
<h2 id="the-risks-of-brushing-scams">The Risks of Brushing Scams</h2>
<p><strong>Personal Data Exposure:</strong></p>
<p>Receiving unsolicited parcels may indicate that your personal information has been compromised. Scammers typically access names and addresses through data breaches or purchase this information from illegal sources. In some cases, they may possess additional sensitive details, opening the door to identity theft.</p>
<p><strong>Account Suspension:</strong></p>
<p>If a fraudster uses your name to write fake reviews, your e-commerce account could be flagged or suspended by the platform while the issue is investigated.</p>
<p><strong>Misleading Consumers:</strong></p>
<p>Fake reviews can mislead you into purchasing low-quality products, especially when inflated ratings and positive comments are posted en masse.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Hazards:</strong></p>
<p>Some items involved in brushing scams, such as cosmetics, could be harmful. Other items, like flower seeds, may pose biosecurity risks or introduce invasive species to your local ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-a-brushing-scam">Reporting a Brushing Scam</h2>
<p>If you’ve received an unexpected package and suspect it’s part of a brushing scam, report it to the online marketplace involved. Platforms typically provide a form for users to submit reports on fraudulent packages. Here’s how to handle it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into your account and locate the report section.</li>
<li>If the package is not a gift, and the platform has no record of it, it’s likely part of a scam.</li>
<li>Fill out the form and submit the details about the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also report the incident to your local consumer protection agency or, in the case of U.S. residents, to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-handle-an-amazon-brushing-scam">How to Handle an Amazon Brushing Scam</h2>
<p>If the scam occurs on Amazon, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into your Amazon account.</li>
<li>Navigate to the “Report Unsolicited Package” section.</li>
<li>Provide the relevant details, such as tracking number and a description of the package.</li>
<li>Amazon will investigate, and it may take up to 10 days to receive an update.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important not to consume or use the product, especially if its quality is questionable or if it’s an item like cosmetics or food. Update your passwords for Amazon and any linked accounts and monitor your financial statements for suspicious activity.</p>
<h2 id="protecting-yourself-from-brushing-scams">Protecting Yourself from Brushing Scams</h2>
<p>Here are some steps to prevent falling victim to brushing scams:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Secure Your Accounts:</strong><br>
Update your passwords regularly and enable two-factor authentication for added security.</li>
<li><strong>Report Unsolicited Packages:</strong><br>
If you receive a package you didn’t order, immediately report it to the platform where it came from.</li>
<li><strong>Verify Seller Reviews:</strong><br>
Before buying from a new seller, scrutinize their reviews. Genuine reviews often contain specific details about the product or shipping process, while fake reviews tend to be more generic.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to Reputable Sellers:</strong><br>
Always buy from trusted sellers with long-standing accounts. Inspect their product images carefully to avoid fake or misleading listings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-am-i-receiving-unordered-packages-from-china">Why Am I Receiving Unordered Packages from China?</h2>
<p>If you receive unexpected items from China or other overseas locations, it could be a sign of a brushing scam, especially if the items appear low-quality or irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-get-an-unknown-package-from-usps">What Should I Do If I Get an Unknown Package from USPS?</h2>
<p>If you receive a package you didn’t order via USPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact USPS immediately.</li>
<li>If unopened, mark the package “Return to sender” for free return.</li>
<li>If you also receive a phishing email, report it as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brushing scams are a growing concern, but by staying vigilant and taking appropriate steps, you can protect your personal information and avoid falling prey to these deceptive tactics. Always report suspicious packages and reviews, and be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar sellers.</p>
