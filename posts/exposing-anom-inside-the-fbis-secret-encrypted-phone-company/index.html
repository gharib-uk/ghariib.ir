<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 19, 2024</p>
<p>Joseph Cox, author of the 2024 book “Dark Wire: The Incredible True Story of the Largest Sting Operation Ever“, came on the Cybercrime Magazine Podcast to share the inside story of the largest law-enforcement sting operation ever, in which the FBI made its own tech start-up to wiretap the world.</p>
<p>In 2018, a powerful app for secure communications called Anom took root among organized criminals. They believed Anom allowed them to conduct business in the shadows. Except for one thing: it was secretly run by the FBI.</p>
<p>Backdoor access to Anom and a series of related investigations granted American, Australian, and European authorities a front-row seat to the underworld. Tens of thousands of criminals worldwide appeared in full view of the same agents they were trying to evade. International smugglers. Money launderers. Hitmen. A sprawling global economy as efficient and interconnected as the legal one. Officers watched drug shipments and murder plots unfold, making arrests without blowing their cover.</p>
<p>But, as the FBI started to lose control of Anom, did the agency go too far? Cox tells Cybercrime Magazine Podcast host and Editor-at-Large David Braue the riveting story.</p>
