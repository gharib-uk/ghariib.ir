				<p>In today’s cyber threat landscape, good enough is no longer good enough. Cyberattacks don’t clock out at 5 PM, and neither can your security strategy. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), offering customers 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response isn’t just a competitive advantage—it’s an essential service for business continuity, customer trust, and staying ahead of attackers.</p>
<p>But delivering round-the-clock security coverage is easier said than done. It requires the right tools, expertise, and scale. This is why partnering with OpenText for offering managed detection and response (MDR) can help MSPs deliver on this critical need without overburdening their resources.</p>
<h2 id="the-case-for-247-cybersecurity-protection">The case for 24/7 cybersecurity protection</h2>
<p>Let’s face it: the cyber threat landscape is relentless, and the game is changing fast. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) make up the core customer base for MSPs and are often top targets for cyberattacks. Cybercriminals see SMBs as easier to exploit—with fewer resources for advanced defenses and treasure troves of valuable data.</p>
<p>But what makes the modern threat landscape even more dangerous is the speed and sophistication with which cybercriminals operate. Attackers are no longer lone actors poking at vulnerabilities. They are part of well-funded by rogue nations, highly organized operations using advanced techniques, automation, and artificial intelligence to breach systems faster than ever.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The numbers don’t lie:</strong> SMBs are the victims of <strong>43% of cyberattacks</strong>. And many of these attacks happen outside of business hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cybercrime costs are skyrocketing:</strong> Global cybercrime damages are expected to hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, and businesses without adequate security measures face steep financial and reputational losses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance mandates are tightening:</strong> Regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS mean SMBs are under growing pressure to protect their sensitive data 24/7.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For MSPs, this means your customers need more than basic firewalls and endpoint protection. They need real-time monitoring, proactive threat hunting, and rapid incident response—all delivered 24/7. Anything less, and you risk leaving customers vulnerable to costly breaches.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-for-msps-scaling-247-coverage">The challenge for MSPs: Scaling 24/7 coverage</h2>
<p>For MSPs, managing a large number of customers, the question becomes: How do you respond in real-time to stop these lightning-fast threats before they cause irreparable damage? Providing 24/7 cybersecurity protection is no easy task for MSPs. Building an in-house security operations center (SOC) to handle threats around the clock is both costly and resource-intensive.</p>
<p>Some common challenges include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Talent shortages:</strong> The cybersecurity industry faces a well-documented skills gap, making it hard for MSPs to find and keep experienced analysts. This challenge is so widespread that 43% of MSPs cite it as their biggest obstacle to delivering security services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High costs:</strong> The expense of creating an in-house SOC can be astronomical, often reaching millions. In fact, 33% of MSPs identify the overwhelming cost of needing numerous cybersecurity tools as a major barrier to offering security services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolving threats:</strong> Cybercriminals are constantly adapting and refining their attack strategies, making it essential for MSPs to stay ahead. This ongoing evolution demands continuous investment in both training for an MSP’s security team and the latest technologies to effectively detect and mitigate new types of threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is where OpenText MDR comes in, empowering MSPs to deliver enterprise-grade protection without the heavy lifting of building your own in-house SOC.</p>

<h2 id="why-msps-cant-afford-to-wait">Why MSPs can’t afford to wait</h2>
<p>In a world where attackers can compromise a network in under an hour, every second counts. Without the ability to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real time, your customers face serious risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Downtime from a successful attack, leading to lost revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of sensitive data, with potential regulatory fines to follow.</p>
