<li>
<p>Make sure to include server and company locations. If they use BitPay or Coinbase please flag this. Additional notes (what level of anonymity is allowed at signup, whether they offer block storage / are suited to running Bitcoin full nodes, etc) are welcome. Particularly interested in hosts that take Lightning payments and hosts in exotic locations. Yes, you can request listing for a company you own or work for, we love to hear from providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using BitPay, Coinbase or using providers that require it is discouraged: many readers have complained BitPay requires a separate account and extensive personal information from the customer in order to pay for services from BitPay-using merchants. Coinbase has recently changed their service and will require the same as BitPay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to draconian new laws being pushed worldwide, I STRONGLY recommend hosting providers move to self-hosted payment processing (e.g BTCPayServer). We have a suggestions for hosting providers page with more information on this for payment providers, along with some other tips.</p>
