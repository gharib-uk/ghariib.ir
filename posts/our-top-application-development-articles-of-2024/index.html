<h2 id="the-top-10-most-popular-app-dev-articles-of-2024">The top 10 most popular app dev articles of 2024</h2>
<p>This year&rsquo;s most popular topics include Kafka data storage and migration, API management, simplifying software security and identity access management. Solutions like Red Hat Developer Hub also garnered a lot of attention as engineering teams continue to seek ways to eliminate friction in the development process.</p>
<h3 id="10-how-to-navigate-api-evolution-with-versioning">#10: How to navigate API evolution with versioning </h3>
<p>By <strong>Jaya Christina Baskaran</strong></p>
<p>APIs and API management form critical pieces of an enterprise’s technology landscape. With the evolution of business needs and the enterprise and technology landscape, changes to APIs become inevitable. With the evolution of business needs and the enterprise and technology landscape, changes to APIs become inevitable. The only constant is change, and APIs are no exception. Therefore, it is important how well enterprises are adapted to change when it occurs—because it is bound to occur.</p>
<p>To better manage changes to APIs, the API management artifacts need to be versioned just like any other software. This article is a strategic guide to versioning intentionally. For a glimpse of versioning in action, the API Versioning solution pattern dives into how a fictitious retail company evolved to handle new versions of an API across all layers: backend, API management platform, API consumers.</p>

<h3 id="9-protect-applications-with-red-hat-build-of-keycloak-using-kerberos--active-directory">#9: Protect applications with Red Hat build of Keycloak using Kerberos &amp; Active Directory </h3>
<p>By <strong>Torbjorn Dahlen</strong> </p>
<p>This article demonstrates how workstation users authenticating to Active Directory with the Kerberos protocol can use Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) tokens with Red Hat build of Keycloak technology for single sign-on to web applications.</p>
<p>By extending the standard Red Hat build of Keycloak image with a Kerberos client and configuring User Federation with Active Directory in Red Hat build of Keycloak, users with an account on Windows Server and using Kerberos to authenticate to their workstation, can still access web applications deployed on Red Hat OpenShift.</p>

<h3 id="8-red-hat-trusted-software-supply-chain-is-now-available">#8: Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain is now available </h3>
<p>By <strong>Markus Nagel</strong> </p>
<p>The article gives an overview of Red Hat Trusted Software Supply Chain, a product family that addresses the many challenges of managing security risks in modern application development, particularly with Kubernetes, container images, and third-party libraries. </p>
<p>Tools like Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline and Red Hat Developer Hub provide solutions like automated code signing, vulnerability scanning, Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs), and compliance checks. Together these capabilities help simplify security for developers and operations teams while ensuring security-focused, efficient application deployment in containerized environments. </p>

<h3 id="7-red-hat-build-of-keycloak-high-availability-a-simplified-approach">#7: Red Hat build of Keycloak high availability: A simplified approach </h3>
<p>By <strong>Mohammad Ahmad</strong> </p>
<p>As of Red Hat build of Keycloak 22, creating a highly available Keycloak solution can introduce operational complexity and performance issues. For example, to have multiple instances of Keycloak that share the same session information, a common cache that is available to all Keycloak instances is a must (in this case, Red Hat Data Grid common to two Red Hat OpenShift clusters) as well a common database (that is highly available and/or fault tolerant).</p>
<p>This article describes a proof of concept for creating a highly available Keycloak configuration using Red Hat OpenShift without relying on a shared cache or database. It also walks through the steps to configure the infrastructure for the potential solution, including OpenShift clusters, Postgres database, and Keycloak setup.</p>

<h3 id="6-what-is-platform-engineering-and-why-do-we-need-it">#6: What is platform engineering and why do we need it? </h3>
<p>By <strong>Markus Eisele</strong> </p>
<p>The sheer amount of tasks and decisions in a developer&rsquo;s day can surpass what&rsquo;s manageable, leading to a significant slowdown in actual development. Terms like &ldquo;cognitive load&rdquo; and &ldquo;burnout&rdquo; come up for a reason. Development and Ops teams must balance mastering complex technologies in development and production while also integrating them securely and in accordance with company standards.</p>
<p>How do we break the overwhelming Dev/Ops cycle without stifling developer freedom? Platform engineering is the answer because it provides developers with a foundation: infrastructure, tools, and established processes. This helps them be more effective and reduces repetitive tasks.</p>

<h3 id="5-enable-fine-grained-api-authorization-using-keycloak-and-3scale">#5: Enable fine-grained API authorization using Keycloak and 3scale </h3>
<p>By <strong>Abdelhamid Soliman</strong> </p>
<p>This article introduces the Keycloak authorizer custom policy and details how to integrate Red Hat 3scale API Management with Red Hat build of Keycloak Authorization Services to decouple your API authorization policies. Red Hat build of Keycloak is based on the Keycloak open source identity and access management solution, which provides features like single sign-on (SSO), user management, OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect support, and authorization services.</p>
<p>Learn how to externalize API authorization decisions from the API gateway and your microservices by leveraging Keycloak Authorization Services as a centralized authorization component.</p>

<h3 id="3-kafka-tiered-storage-deep-dive">#3: Kafka tiered storage deep dive </h3>
<p>By <strong>Federico Valeri</strong> and <strong>Luke Chen</strong> </p>
<p>Tiered storage is a new early access feature available as of Apache Kafka 3.6.0.  This article explores the need for remote storage in Kafka, particularly for retaining historical data critical for various use cases like disaster recovery, data analytics, and machine learning. It focuses on tiered storage implementation, which allows you to scale compute and storage resources independently, provides better client isolation, and faster maintenance of your Kafka cluster. </p>
<p>The introduction of Kafka tiered storage presents a standardized, built-in solution. By leveraging different storage tiers based on data access patterns, performance needs, and cost considerations, tiered storage optimizes resource utilization while ensuring efficient data management.</p>
