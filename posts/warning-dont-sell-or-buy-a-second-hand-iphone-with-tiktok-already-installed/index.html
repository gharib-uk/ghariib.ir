			<h1>&lt;div&gt;Warning: Don’t sell or buy a second hand iPhone with TikTok already installed&lt;/div&gt;</h1>

				<p>After TikTok was briefly banned in the US last weekend, an unusual phenomenon unearthed. Reportedly, people are selling iPhones that have TikTok installed for up to $25,000.</p>
<p>This may require some explanation, so bear with me.</p>
<p>TikTok has had a rough time in the US the last weeks. The ban we mentioned originates from back in March, when the House of Representatives passed a bill that would effectively ban TikTok from the US unless Chinese owner ByteDance agreed to give up its share of the immensely popular app.</p>
<p>Despite an overruled emergency injunction to stop or postpone the planned ban on the platform in the US, the ban took effect on January 19.</p>
<p>But TikTok’s messaging was clear, they were coming back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Sorry TikTok isn’t available right now</p>
<p>A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately that means you can’t Use TikTok for now.</p>
<p>We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!</p></blockquote>
<p>And it was indeed back for millions of US users as of January 19 and 20. That is to say, for those that had the app installed.</p>

<p>Update 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome back!</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!</p>
<p>You can continue to create, share, and discover all the thing you love on TikTok.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, anyone that deleted or never had the app installed are unable to download it as the Apple and Google app stores in the US still don’t have it available. And despite an executive order to delay enforcing the ban, it is unclear when it will be available for download again.</p>
<h2 id="second-hand-iphones-for-sale">Second hand iPhones for sale</h2>
<p>Some people have seized on this as a money-making opportunity, selling their iPhones for thousands of dollars on eBay. But is that a smart thing to do?</p>
<p>According to Apple’s Support pages, there is a recommended procedure to follow before you sell, give away, or trade in your iPhone or iPad. One of those steps is to <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong>. From that page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When you tap <strong>Erase All Content and Settings</strong>, it completely erases your device, including any credit or debit cards you added for Apple Pay and any photos, contacts, music, or apps. It will also turn off iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, Game Center, and other services. Your content won’t be deleted from iCloud when you erase your device.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to leave an app like TikTok behind, you will have to manually erase all the other items on that list to make sure the buyer will not get hold of other private information about you. This is tough to do and is highly likely you would leave some of your data behind.</p>
<p>If you’re considering buying a second hand iPhone so you can use TikTok, how can you be sure that TikTok is the only thing that’s left behind? I wouldn’t put it past cybercriminals to sell devices they can still access, or even malware.</p>
<p>Another bad idea is to roam the internet for unofficial TikTok apps (in the form of IPA or APK files). Installing an unsigned app requires a jailbreak and it can pose significant risks to your device and personal data. Files from unreliable sources may contain malware, spyware, or information stealers and, once installed, these malicious programs can compromise your device’s security.</p>
<p>My advice would be to exercise some patience. TikTok may well reappear in app stores or it’ll be completely removed from access, so everyone will be in the same boat.</p>
