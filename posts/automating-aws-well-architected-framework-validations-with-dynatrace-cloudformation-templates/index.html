<p>Dynatrace is proud to be the first AWS global tech partner to offer <strong>ready-to-use CloudFormation templates</strong> for validating the Well-Architected pillars. The Dynatrace CloudFormation templates are now available in the <strong>AWS CloudFormation Public Extensions Registry</strong>, which makes Well-Architected validation even more accessible for AWS users.</p>
<p>Dynatrace and the AWS Well-Architected Framework ensure continuous optimization of cloud architecture, aligning with the key pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability. Our previous blog post discussed the importance of integrating Dynatrace with the AWS Well-Architected Framework to enhance your software development lifecycle (SDLC). By leveraging Dynatrace Workflow Automation and the Site Reliability Guardian, organizations can ensure that their applications meet AWS’s best practices across all pillars.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-start-for-aws-users">A quick start for AWS users</h2>
<p>AWS users can now benefit from ready-to-use CloudFormation templates that allow for the rapid deployment of Dynatrace workflows designed to validate your cloud architecture against the AWS Well-Architected Framework. These templates are available directly from the AWS CloudFormation Public Extensions Registry, enabling any AWS user to integrate Dynatrace’s observability and release validation capabilities into their infrastructure in just a few steps.</p>
<p>This quick-start approach is especially beneficial for organizations looking to streamline their SDLC and ensure their applications align with the AWS Well-Architected Framework before production deployment. The templates also serve as a foundation for extending workflows, allowing you to tailor the solution to specific business needs and requirements.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-the-dynatrace-cloudformation-templates">Key features of the Dynatrace CloudFormation templates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Out-of-the-box validation for AWS best practices</strong>: These CloudFormation templates automatically provision the necessary Dynatrace resources to continuously validate your infrastructure against AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars. This means you can automatically review your applications for performance efficiency, security, cost optimization, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless deployment</strong>: Once you download them from the AWS Public Extensions Registry, you can deploy these CloudFormation templates with minimal effort. They help teams automate best practice checks and validations in minutes, reducing manual intervention and ensuring faster, more reliable deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Automation at scale</strong>: Using Dynatrace Workflow Automation available through these templates, you can automate the release validation process across your entire AWS environment. This includes vital capabilities such as continuous release validation, automated rollback mechanisms for failed validations, and integration with your CI/CD pipelines for full automation throughout the SDLC.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible for custom needs</strong>: While the templates provide a robust foundation, they’re also extensible. Whether you need to integrate additional validation criteria or customize workflows for specific services, you can easily modify the templates to fit your unique requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dynatrace-cloudformation-templates-accelerate-the-path-to-production">Dynatrace CloudFormation templates accelerate the path to production</h2>
<p>Implementing the Well-Architected Framework for organizations using AWS is critical to building secure, reliable, and cost-efficient cloud applications. However, this can often be a time-consuming process involving manual validations and checks at multiple stages of the SDLC.</p>
<p>By using the new Dynatrace CloudFormation templates, AWS users can <strong>automate the validation</strong> of their cloud infrastructure, vetting every release against the core pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework before it reaches production. This reduces the risk of performance or security issues and helps organizations adopt cloud-native practices faster by automating tedious manual tasks.</p>
<p>Moreover, because the <strong>Site Reliability Guardian</strong> is included in these templates, you can continuously monitor and validate essential application metrics like <strong>response times</strong>, <strong>CPU usage</strong>, and error rates to verify your application meets its <strong>service level objectives (SLOs)</strong> before every deployment. This drastically reduces the likelihood of post-release issues and provides peace of mind for development teams.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-the-dynatrace-cloudformation-templates">How to get started with the Dynatrace CloudFormation templates</h2>
<p>Getting started with these new CloudFormation templates is easy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access the templates</strong>: Head to the AWS CloudFormation Public Extensions Registry and search for the third-party extensions of Dynatrace.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy the solution</strong>: Use the CloudFormation console to deploy the templates in your Dynatrace environment.</li>
<li><strong>Extend as needed</strong>: Once deployed, you can customize the Dynatrace workflow to fit your specific SDLC requirements, adding additional validation criteria or integrating with other AWS services like <strong>Lambda</strong>, <strong>S3</strong>, or <strong>EC2</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor and optimize</strong>: With Dynatrace now fully integrated, you can continuously monitor application performance, detect anomalies in real- time, and optimize your infrastructure on AWS based on actionable insights.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="streamlining-the-sdlc">Streamlining the SDLC</h2>
<p>Adding <strong>Dynatrace CloudFormation templates</strong> in the AWS Public Extensions Registry is a game-changer for organizations looking to streamline their SDLC according to the AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars. With ready-to-use automation workflows, seamless integration into AWS, and the ability to extend and customize the solution, these templates provide a fast, powerful way to improve your cloud applications’ reliability, security, and efficiency.</p>
<p>By leveraging this new capability, AWS users can now automate what was once a manual, error-prone process, confidently accelerating their path to production.</p>
<p>Check out the AWS CloudFormation Public Extensions Registry to get started today and bring Dynatrace-powered validation into your AWS SDLC.</p>
