<p>Today I&rsquo;m really excited to announce a big piece of work 1Password and I have been focusing on this year, a totally free video series called &ldquo;Hello CISO&rdquo;. This is a multi-part series that launched with part 1 and when I say &ldquo;free&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;give us your personal data so we can market to you&rdquo;, I mean here it is, <em>properly</em> free:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is intended to be a very practical, broadly accessible series and whilst it has &ldquo;CISO&rdquo; in the title, we expect it&rsquo;ll be relevant well beyond the pointy end of the infosec ladder. Part 1 on the downfall of on-prem security is a perfect example of that; all of us in the industry have heard the old school thinking of all the good stuff being on the inside of the network and all the bad stuff being on the outside. However, if you&rsquo;ve been around for a few years, you&rsquo;ve seen this &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; thing absolutely smashing that idea. A few years before that mobile devices did the same thing. Back a bit further and it was USB sticks. The whole idea of a &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; is constantly being redefined and that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve decided to begin this series.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t spoil the surprise by detailing everything that&rsquo;s yet to come, suffice to say there many other areas of infosec that are equally important to grasp and are uniquely different in their own way. I&rsquo;m really glad this series is in video format as it gives me an opportunity to express my passion for the industry and because each part in the series will be short clips like the 10 minute one above, it&rsquo;s super easy to consume.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy part 1 and stay tuned for future parts in the weeks and months to come.</p>
