				<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs</p>
<h2 id="different-sbom-generation-tools-comparison">Different SBOM generation tools comparison</h2>
<p>If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization.</p>
<p>Note: Here we’re only considering open source tools</p>
<h3 id="1---anchore-syft">1 - Anchore Syft</h3>
<p><em><strong>Introduction:</strong></em></p>
<p>Anchoreis a platform that implements sbom-powered supply chain security solutions for developers and enterprises. For generating SBOMs, a CLI tool and library named Syft was developed by Anchore that could be injected into your ci/cd pipeline to generate SBOMs from container images and filesystems at each step.</p>
<p><em><strong>Integration and Support:</strong></em></p>
<p>Syft is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows and it can run as a docker container which makes it a great suit for CI systems. Other than the 3 SBOM standards, Syft can generate its JSON standard format to be input for other Anchore tools like Grype which is a vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems.

<li>Other than the command <code>bom generate</code>, it uses <code>bom document</code> to work with already present SPDX documents to outline and draw a structure for them</li>
<li>It doesn’t necessarily require a whole project directory but it can specify a single file to analyze with the <code>-f path/to/file</code> flag and it can have a collection of those files to be analyzed together.</li>
<li>It also supports the namespacing separation between SBOM documents using the <code>-n &lt;URI&gt;</code> flag to isolate each document from the other</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4--microsoft-sbom-tool">4- Microsoft SBOM tool</h3>
<p><em><strong>Introduction:</strong></em></p>
<p>Recently, Microsoft open-sourced their SBOM generation tool which is described as a general purpose, enterprise-proven, build-time SBOM generator. They have been developing the tool internally since 2019 and tuning its feature according to their needs and providing other companies with the solution. What is new is that Microsoft has chosen to merge efforts with the Linux Foundation’s work and use Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) for all SBOMs generated, and to do this for all software produced. It has a promising number of features like including other SBOM documents recursively to provide its users with the ability to have a full dependency tree that goes to the origin of every package.</p>
<p><em><strong>Integration and Support:</strong></em></p>
<p>Microsoft SBOM is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can be easily integrated into and auto-detects the following package managers</p>
<p><code>NPM, NuGet, PyPI, CocoaPods, Maven, Golang, Rust Crates, RubyGems, Linux packages within containers, Gradle, Ivy, GitHub public repositories</code></p>
<p>and Microsoft is adding more detectors to improve deeper integration with the community. The tool is currently committed to generating the SPDX 2.2.1 format for its users and is still in development to include all optional fields before integrating with other formats.</p>
<p><em><strong>Features and Specs:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enterprise ready and highly scalable as already used at scale by Microsoft</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding build provenance information to the SBOM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auto-detection of the underlying package manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports namespacing separation between SBOM documents with the <code>-nsb</code> flag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validating SBOMs at release using hashes and digital signatures</p>

<h3 id="5--tern">5- Tern</h3>
<p><em><strong>Introduction:</strong></em></p>
<p>Tern is a VMware-originated open source inspection tool used to generate SBOMs following standard formats. It gathers metadata for the packages installed in container images and Dockerfiles. Tern starts to analyze the contents of a container (through the image itself or the Dockerfile), layer by layer, without requiring the user to have in-depth technical knowledge about how the container was built.</p>
<p><em><strong>Integration and Support:</strong></em></p>
<p>Tern itself is available as a Github Action but it is mainly supported to be installed as a CLI tool on Linux. With Linux installation, Tern is built with python so it requires python, pip, and jq installed mainly (more about installation here). Some features like analyzing Dockerfiles and the lock function require Docker installation in your Linux. Moreover, Tern can run as a docker container which makes it easy to use in ci systems and can be used as a workaround to run on other operating systems like Windows, and macOS. Also, this helps to deploy Tern as a Kubernetes job with a host mount to retrieve generated SBOMs.</p>
<p>For now, Tern only supports container images built using Docker using image manifest version 2, schema 2 and it will support Docker images and it is aimed to support other images that follow the OCI standards in the future.</p>
<p>For license compliance, Term doesn’t have its file-level license analyzer. So, it allows you to extend its analysis using an external CLI tool or Python packages as extensions. An example is Scancode which is a CLI tool used for license compliance along with other supported integrations like cve-bin-tool for vulnerability scanning.</p>
<p>Tern supports generating reports with multiple formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Readable Simple format</li>
<li>JSON format</li>
<li>HTML format</li>
<li>YAML format</li>
<li>SPDX tag-value Format</li>
<li>SPDX JSON Format</li>
<li>CycloneDX JSON Format</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Features and Specs:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>CLI is easy to use and can be installed as a docker container which makes it suitable for CI/CD solutions</li>
<li>Multiple supported output formats which are readable for both humans and machines</li>
<li>Ability to generate SBOMs following both SPDX and CycloneDX formats</li>
<li>Support for Dockerfile locking to create more reproducible Docker images which is a unique feature supported by Tern only, view more about it here.</li>
<li>The concept of extensions/plugins is only supported by Tern between all the previously mentioned tools. This is a great feature that is proven to extend its capabilities in the coming future and open for creativity from the open source community (this was proven before to increase the functionality and popularity of other tools like Jenkins).</li>
</ul>
