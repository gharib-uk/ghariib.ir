				<p>To support our customers in securing their generative AI workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are excited to announce the launch of a new AWS Skill Builder course: Securing Generative AI on AWS.</p>
<p>This comprehensive course is designed to help security professionals, architects, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) engineers understand and implement security best practices for generative AI applications and models in the AWS Cloud.</p>
<p>AWS Skill Builder is a learning center for AWS customers and partners to build cloud skills through digital trainings, self-paced labs, and other course types. AWS Skill Builder has a variety of AWS security content to help customers understand concepts and gain hands-on experience with AWS security.</p>
<p>The course highlights are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction to the Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix</strong> – Learn how to categorize and secure different AI implementations by using this innovative framework.</li>
<li><strong>Coverage of key AI security frameworks</strong> – Gain insights into the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs) and the MITRE ATLAS framework.</li>
<li><strong>Practical security strategies</strong> – Develop skills to implement comprehensive security across the areas of governance, legal, risk, controls, and resilience for various AI scopes.</li>
<li><strong>Real-world applications</strong> – Apply security concepts to case studies covering consumer applications, enterprise solutions, pre-trained models, fine-tuned models, and self-trained models.</li>
