			<h1>From Turbulence to Transformation: A CIO’s Journey at Southwest Airlines</h1>

				<p>When Southwest Airlines’ crew scheduling system became overwhelmed during the 2022 holiday season, the company faced what would become a $800 million operational meltdown. CIO Lauren Woods and her technology team hadn’t caused the crisis, but they would need to solve it. </p>
<p>“I liken it to being like a designated driver at a party,” Woods reflects. “You didn’t bring the Wild Turkey, but all of a sudden you’re responsible for getting everybody home safe.”</p>
<p>That crisis—and how Woods’ team responded to it—exemplifies a fundamental truth about enterprise technology leadership: the most valuable innovations often emerge from moments of greatest pressure. </p>
<p>Speaking at the 2024 Enterprise Technology Leadership Summit, Woods revealed how her organization transformed multiple crises into opportunities for technological reinvention, ultimately leading to Southwest’s lowest flight cancellation rate among US airlines in 2024.</p>
<p>Her story offers a masterclass on how technology organizations can build resilience and drive transformation, even when—especially when—circumstances seem least favorable for innovation.</p>
<h2 id="the-technology-behind-americas-largest-carrier"><strong>The Technology Behind America’s Largest Carrier</strong></h2>
<p>Southwest Airlines, which began in 1971 with just three aircraft serving three cities in Texas, has grown to become the United States’ largest passenger carrier, employing over 74,000 people and serving nearly 120 airports across 11 countries. The airline’s technology department, led by Woods, supports an extensive ecosystem of custom-built applications and integrated vendor products that manage everything from flight operations and fare pricing to luggage tracking and crew planning.</p>
<p>Woods, who joined Southwest 14 years ago and was appointed CIO in early 2023, has overseen numerous transformative initiatives. These include multiple website replacements, large-scale agile transformations, the implementation of the Amadeus reservation system (which generated over $1 billion in benefits), and the company’s migration to cloud infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="turning-crisis-into-opportunity-the-pandemic-response"><strong>Turning Crisis into Opportunity: The Pandemic Response</strong></h2>
<p>When COVID-19 struck and airline revenues plummeted by 95%, Southwest’s technology team used the downturn as an opportunity to strengthen its foundation. “Like I said, we have a history of being scrappy and resilient, and in hard times we fortify ourselves and we become stronger,” Woods explained.</p>
<p>During this period, the technology department focused on what Woods called “the essential highways”—critical infrastructure improvements that, while not particularly glamorous, were fundamental to future success. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modernizing pipeline capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accelerating the closure of legacy data centers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building new data platforms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a robust data foundation with cloud data warehouse and lake capabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transitioning to real-time data streaming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Converting to an employee-led workforce model</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigating-through-turbulence-the-holiday-crisis-response"><strong>Navigating Through Turbulence: The Holiday Crisis Response</strong></h2>
<p>The true test of these improvements came during a severe operational disruption during a recent holiday season. While technology wasn’t the root cause, it became central to the solution. Woods’s team responded by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implementing rapid customer self-service solutions for refunds and reimbursements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a large-scale lost luggage tracking system in just days</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing “Cairo,” a new tool that helps recommend which flights to cancel while minimizing crew network impacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building systems that process data 12 times faster than previous capabilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The results speak for themselves: Southwest achieved one of its best December operational performances in years, with fewer than 1% of scheduled flights canceled. By 2024, the airline boasted the lowest cancellation rate among US carriers.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-in-leadership"><strong>Lessons in Leadership</strong></h2>
<p>Woods emphasized three key principles for technology leaders:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Put Your Oxygen Mask on First</strong>: Invest in your foundation—whether it’s technology, leadership, or teamwork—before tackling broader challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change Your Altitude</strong>: Sometimes, rising above turbulence requires a change in perspective. This mindset helped Southwest transition from solving immediate problems to preventing future ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Hard Challenges</strong>: Doing difficult things creates competitive advantages. The experience gained through crisis management has positioned Southwest to deliver unique value at an accelerating pace.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-road-ahead-transformative-changes"><strong>The Road Ahead: Transformative Changes</strong></h2>
<p>Southwest is now leveraging its strengthened technological foundation to implement some of the most significant changes in its 50-year history. The airline is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embracing DevOps principles and cloud-native, microservice-based architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing both traditional and generative AI solutions to enhance employee productivity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparing for a fundamental shift in its customer experience model with the introduction of assigned seating – a massive technological undertaking that will touch every system in the airline’s operation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-technology-leaders-mindset"><strong>The Technology Leader’s Mindset</strong></h2>
<p>Woods’s journey at Southwest illustrates how technology leaders can turn challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation. Her experience shows that while crises are inevitable, they can become catalysts for positive change when approached with the right mindset and supported by solid technological foundations.</p>
<p>The transition from a scrappy startup with three planes to America’s largest carrier demonstrates that maintaining a culture of resilience and innovation is crucial for long-term success. </p>
<p>As Woods puts it, “Everyone hits turbulence from time to time, but navigating beyond the hard things will create a competitive advantage for you.”</p>
<p>For technology leaders across industries, the message is clear: invest in your foundation, be ready to change perspective when needed, and approach challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation. In today’s rapidly evolving business environment, these principles are more relevant than ever.</p>
