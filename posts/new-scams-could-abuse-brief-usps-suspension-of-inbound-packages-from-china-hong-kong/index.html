			<h1>New scams could abuse brief USPS suspension of inbound packages from China, Hong Kong</h1>

				<p>I would be the last one to provide scammers with good ideas, but as a security provider, sometimes we need to think like criminals to stay ahead in the race.</p>
<p>Recently, the US Postal Service (USPS) announced that it would suspend inbound packages from China and Hong Kong until further notice. That further notice, it turned out, was very short indeed, with the USPS announcing on February 5 that the interruption in service would itself be disrupted—packages were once again approved to enter the country. But the whiplash announcements, the second of which was dropped with little fanfare, have caused confusion.</p>
<p>So, there is an opportunity for scammers to exploit that confusion and uncertainty. Let me spell out how:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scammers could send messages about refunds based on packages that could not be sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A revival of the old “Your package could not be delivered” scam could spring up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phishers could send messages about goods that were rerouted through other countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goods—including counterfeit—could be offered for sale at “pre-tariff” rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malicious messages could claim to arrive from the shipper, the e-commerce platform, or Customs, asking for additional information to get a package released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cybercriminals may set up fake USPS sites—as they have done in the past—to intercept searches for Track &amp; Trace information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Scammers are always looking to make money over other people’s backs. They will usually enter some kind of urgency into their messaging, like a time before which you have to respond. This is a good indicator because they don’t want you to think things through before you act.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-stay-safe">How can you stay safe?</h2>
<p>It’s best not to respond to any of these attempts, to avoid letting scammers know that someone is reading their attempts. It will likely cause an increase in spam and other attempts.</p>
<p>Depending on how the scam reaches you and what it is after, there are several ways to stay safe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a solution that offers text protection and text message filtering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not click on unsolicited links or open unsolicited attachments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not trust that sponsored ads lead to the legitimate company, we are seeing too many fakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not trust links that use URL-shorteners, or at least unshorten the link before following it. The same is true for QR codes which are basically URLs in a different shape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doublecheck the source of messages through a trusted way of communication with the shipper, e-commerce platform, or customs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And please report fraud attempts with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), so others can be warned about common scams.</p>
