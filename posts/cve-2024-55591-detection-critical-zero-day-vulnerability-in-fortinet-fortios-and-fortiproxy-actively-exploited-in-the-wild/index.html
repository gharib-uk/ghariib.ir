<h2 id="cve-2024-55591-analysis">CVE-2024-55591 Analysis</h2>
<p>On January 14, 2025, Fortinet issued a security advisory regarding CVE-2024-55591, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability impacting FortiOS versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.16, FortiProxy versions 7.0.0 to 7.0.19, and FortiProxy versions 7.2.0 to 7.2.12. The flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Node.js websocket module. If successfully exploited, the attacker can gain super-admin privileges on the affected device. </p>
<p>Fortinet has confirmed the in-the-wild exploitation of CVE-2024-55591, with research by Arctic Wolf uncovering a malicious campaign active since mid-November 2024 and leveraging the vulnerability in limelight to compromise FortiGate firewall devices with Internet-exposed management interfaces. According to the researchers, the campaign included unauthorized administrative access to firewall management interfaces, the creation of new user accounts, the use of those accounts for SSL VPN authentication, and multiple other modifications to device configurations helping threat actors to establish a path to the internal network. </p>
<p>Fortinet’s advisory suggests users disable the HTTP/HTTPS administrative interface or restrict access to it by using local-in policies to limit which IP addresses can reach the interface. Additionally, users are urged to upgrade to the following safe versions, if possible: FortiOS 7.0.17 or higher (for FortiOS 7.0), FortiProxy 7.0.20 or higher (for FortiProxy 7.0), and FortiProxy 7.2.13 or higher (for FortiProxy 7.2).</p>
<p>SOC Prime Platform for collective cyber defense enables security teams to outscale cyber threats of any scale and sophistication, including CVEs in popular software products that most organizations rely on while helping them to risk-optimize the security posture. </p>
