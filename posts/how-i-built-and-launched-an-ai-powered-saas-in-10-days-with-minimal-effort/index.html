				<h2 id="the-challenge-building-a-mobile-saasfast">The Challenge: Building a Mobile SaaS—Fast</h2>
<p>As an indie hacker, I’m always looking for ways to build and launch projects quickly. I had an idea for an AI-powered meal tracking app that could analyze food images and estimate calories, proteins, and other nutrients. But instead of spending months coding everything manually, I wanted to see how much I could leverage AI to accelerate the process.</p>
<p>The goal was simple: launch a functional and monetizable SaaS in record time, with as little manual coding as possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h2>
<p>I used a modern stack optimized for fast development and scalability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Expo (React Native)</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> expo-router</li>
<li><strong>Backend &amp; Authentication:</strong> Appwrite (Google &amp; Apple Sign-In)</li>
<li><strong>Styling:</strong> NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native)</li>
<li><strong>Localization:</strong> expo-localization + i18next + react-i18next</li>
<li><strong>Payments:</strong> react-native-purchases (RevenueCat)</li>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong> Zustand</li>
<li><strong>Data Revalidation:</strong> TanStack Query</li>
<li><strong>Forms:</strong> React Hook Form</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Requests:</strong> Axios</li>
<li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> MMKV</li>
<li><strong>Ads:</strong> react-native-google-mobile-ads</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ai-driven-development-workflow">The AI-Driven Development Workflow</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-generating-the-base-project">Step 1: Generating the Base Project</h3>
<p>Instead of manually setting up the project structure, I wrote a detailed prompt describing the app and used <strong>bolt.new</strong> to generate the initial codebase. I also included reference UI screenshots to guide the generation process. This alone saved hours of boilerplate coding.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-the-power-of-contextmd">Step 2: The Power of <code>context.md</code></h3>
<p>One of the most critical steps in this process was creating a <strong><code>context.md</code></strong> file. This document contained all the details about the project—architecture, features, folder structure, and coding conventions. Every time I needed to add a new feature, I provided this file as context to AI tools like <strong>Cursor</strong> and AI Agents, ensuring that the generated code followed the same patterns and structure.</p>
<p>The more detailed <strong><code>context.md</code></strong> was, the better the AI-assisted development became. This approach helped:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain consistency across the codebase.</li>
<li>Reduce the need for manual refactoring.</li>
<li>Speed up feature implementation significantly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-3-ai-assisted-iterations">Step 3: AI-Assisted Iterations</h3>
<p>Once I had the base project, I used <strong>Cursor</strong> as my AI-powered IDE to fine-tune the app. Any time I needed to create new features, I asked AI agents to generate code while ensuring consistency by referencing <strong><code>context.md</code></strong>.</p>
<p>This approach allowed me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quickly scaffold new screens and components.</li>
<li>Maintain a consistent coding style across the project.</li>
<li>Avoid repetitive tasks and focus on refining user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-automating-marketing--copywriting">Step 4: Automating Marketing &amp; Copywriting</h3>
<p>I didn’t stop at development—AI also helped with marketing. Using AI tools, I generated:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App Store &amp; Play Store descriptions</strong> (optimized for ASO).</li>
<li><strong>Launch texts for ProductHunt &amp; Reddit</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Social media posts for Twitter (X).</strong></li>
<li><strong>TikTok video scripts to promote the app.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This meant I could focus on shipping while still ensuring the app had a strong launch strategy.</p>
<h2 id="the-outcome">The Outcome</h2>
<p>With AI handling around <strong>80% of the development and marketing work</strong>, I was able to:<br>
✅ Build a working prototype in just a few days.<br>
✅ Integrate payments &amp; gamification to make the app engaging and profitable.<br>
✅ Launch the app without hiring a team or spending months coding manually.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned--key-takeaways">Lessons Learned &amp; Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>1️⃣ <strong>AI doesn’t replace developers, but it massively speeds up the process.</strong> Instead of writing every line of code, I focused on orchestrating AI-generated components.</p>
<p>2️⃣ <strong>Good prompts are essential.</strong> The more detailed my instructions, the better the AI-generated output.</p>
<p>3️⃣ <strong>A well-structured <code>context.md</code> file is a game changer.</strong> The more information it contains, the more consistent and efficient the AI-generated code becomes.</p>
<p>4️⃣ <strong>AI-assisted marketing is a game changer.</strong> Writing store descriptions, social media content, and launch posts took minutes instead of hours.</p>
<p>5️⃣ <strong>Fast execution beats perfection.</strong> The app isn’t “perfect,” but it’s live, and that’s what matters.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This experiment proved that launching a SaaS doesn’t have to take months (or even weeks). With AI tools, indie hackers can move faster than ever, reducing both cost and time-to-market.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear from others: Have you used AI to accelerate your development process? What’s your experience been like?</p>
