				<p>In today’s evolving digital landscape, safeguarding data has become a challenge for organizations of all sizes. The ever-expanding data estate, the volume and complexity of cyberattacks, increasing global regulations, and the rapid adoption of AI are shifting how cybersecurity and data teams secure and govern their data. Today, more than 95% of organizations are implementing or developing an AI strategy, requiring data protection and governance strategies to be optimized for AI adoption.1 Microsoft Purview is designed to help you protect and govern all your data, regardless of where it lives and travels, for the era of AI.</p>
<p>Historically, organizations have relied on the traditional approach to data security and governance, largely involving stitching together fragmented solutions. According to Gartner®, “75% of security leaders are actively pursuing a security vendor consolidation strategy as of 2022.”2 Consolidation, however, is no easy feat. In a recent study, more than 95% of security leaders acknowledge that unifying the handling of data security, compliance, and privacy across teams and tools is both a priority <em>and</em> a challenge.3 These approaches often fall short because of duplicate data, redundant alerts, and siloed investigations, ultimately leading to increased data risks. Over time, this approach has been increasingly difficult for organizations to maintain.</p>

<p>Microsoft Purview enables you to discover, secure, and govern data across Microsoft and third-party sources. Today, Microsoft Purview delivers rich data security capabilities through Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention, Microsoft Purview Information Protection, and Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management, enhanced with AI-powered Adaptive Protection. To drive AI transformation, you need to build and maintain a strong data foundation, categorized by data that is not just secured but also governed. Microsoft Purview also addresses your data governance needs with the newly reimagined Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog. These data security and data governance products leverage shared capabilities such as a common data catalog, connectors, classifications, and audit logs—helping reduce inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and exposure gaps, commonly experienced by using disparate tools.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-microsoft-purview-data-security-posture-management">Introducing Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management</h3>
<p>Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) provides visibility into data security risks and recommends controls to protect that data. DSPM provides contextual insights, usage analysis, and continuous risk assessments of your data, helping you mitigate risks and enhance data security. With DSPM, you get a shared understanding of key risks through a series of reports that correlate insights across location and type of sensitive data, risky user activities, and common exfiltration channels. In addition, DSPM provides actionable, scenario-based recommendations for detection and protection policies. For example, DSPM can help you create an Insider Risk Management policy that identifies risky behavior such as downgrading labels in documents followed by exfiltration, and a data loss prevention (DLP) policy to block that exfiltration at the same time.</p>
<p>DSPM also brings a view of historical trends and insights based on sensitivity labels applied, sensitive assets covered by at least one DLP policy, and potentially risky users so show the effectiveness of your data security policies over time. And finally, DSPM leverages the power of generative AI through its deep integration with Microsoft Security Copilot. With this integration, you can easily uncover risks that might not be immediately apparent and drive efficient and richer investigations—all in natural language.</p>
<p>With DSPM, you can easily identify possible labeling and policy gaps such as unlabeled content and users that aren’t scoped in a DLP policy, unusual patterns and activities that might indicate potential risks, as well as opportunities to adapt and strengthen your data security program.</p>

<h3 id="increasing-data-security-and-security-operations-center-integration">Increasing data security and security operations center integration</h3>
<p>Understanding data and user context is vital for improving security operations and prioritizing investigations, especially when sensitive data is at stake. By integrating insights such as data classification, access controls, and user activity into the security operations center (SOC) experience, organizations can better assess the impact of security incidents, reduce false alerts, and enhance containment efforts. In addition to the already present DLP alerts in the Microsoft Defender XDR incident investigation and data security remediation actions enabled directly from Defender XDR, we’ve also added Insider Risk Management context to the user entity page to provide a more comprehensive view of user activities.</p>
<p>With Microsoft Purview’s latest integration with Microsoft Defender, now in preview, you get insider risk alerts in Defender XDR and can correlate them with incidents. This gives you critical user context for your security investigations. SOC teams can now better distinguish internal incidents from external cyberattacks and refine their response strategies. For more complex analysis to identify risks such as attack patterns, we are integrating insider risk signals into Defender XDR’s Advanced Hunting, giving you deeper insights and allowing you to improve your policies in partnership with data security teams. Together, these advancements allow your organization to stay ahead of evolving cyberthreats, providing a collaborative and data-driven approach to security.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-data-and-preventing-sensitive-data-loss">Protecting data and preventing sensitive data loss</h3>
<p>As AI generates new data in unprecedented volumes, the need to secure that data and prevent the loss of sensitive information has become even more crucial. Our new DLP capabilities help you effectively investigate DLP incidents, fortify existing protections, and refine your overall DLP program. You can now customize Purview DLP to the established processes of your organization with the Microsoft Power Automate connector in preview. This lets you automate and customize your DLP policy actions through Power Automate workflows to integrate your DLP incidents into new or established IT, security, and business operations workflows, like stakeholder awareness or incident remediation.</p>
<p>DLP policy insights in Security Copilot, also in preview, summarize existing DLP policies in natural language and helps you understand any gaps in policy coverage across your environment. This makes it easier for you to quickly and easily understand the full breadth of DLP policy coverage across your organization and address gaps in protection. We are also enhancing DLP protections on endpoints by expanding our file type coverage from more than 40 to more than 110 file types. Users can also now store and view full files on Windows devices as evidence for forensic investigations using Microsoft-managed storage. With the Microsoft-managed option, your admins can save time otherwise spent configuring additional settings, assigning permissions, and selecting the storage in the policy workflow. Finally, you can now enforce blanket protections on file types that cannot currently be scanned or classified by endpoint DLP, such as blocking copy to removable media for all computer-aided design (CAD) files regardless of those files’ contents. This helps ensure that the diverse range of file types found in your environment are still protected even if they cannot currently be scanned and classified by Microsoft Purview endpoint DLP. </p>

<h3 id="introducing-microsoft-data-security-posture-management-for-ai-dspm-for-ai">Introducing Microsoft Data Security Posture Management for AI (DSPM for AI)</h3>
<p>Security teams often find themselves in the dark when it comes to data security and compliance risks associated with AI usage. Without proper visibility, organizations often struggle to safeguard their AI assets effectively. DSPM for AI, now generally available, gives you visibility through a centralized dashboard and reports, enables you to proactively discover and manage your AI-related data risks, such as sensitive data in user prompts, and gives you actionable recommendations and real-time insights to respond effectively to security incidents.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-purview-controls-for-microsoft-365-copilot-help-prevent-data-oversharing">Microsoft Purview controls for Microsoft 365 Copilot help prevent data oversharing</h3>
<p>Data oversharing occurs when users have access to more data than necessary for their job duties. Organizations need effective data security controls to help mitigate this risk. At Microsoft Ignite we announced a number of new Microsoft Purview capabilities in preview to prevent data oversharing in Microsoft 365 Copilot.</p>
<p><strong>Data oversharing assessments</strong>: Discover data that is at risk of oversharing by scanning files containing sensitive data, identifying risky data sources such as SharePoint sites with overly permissive user access, and by providing recommendations such as auto-labeling policies and default labels to prevent sensitive data from being overshared. The oversharing assessment report can identify unlabeled files accessed by users before deploying Copilot or can be run post-deployment to identify sensitive data referenced in Copilot responses. </p>
<p><strong>Label-based permissions</strong>: Microsoft 365 Copilot honors permissions based on sensitivity labels assigned by Microsoft Purview when referencing sensitive documents.</p>
<p><strong>Purview DLP for Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong>: You can create DLP policies to exclude documents with specified sensitivity labels from being processed, summarized, or used in responses in Microsoft 365 Copilot, preventing sensitive data from being inadvertently overshared.</p>
<h3 id="new-microsoft-purview-capabilities-to-detect-risky-activities-in-microsoft-365-copilot">New Microsoft Purview capabilities to detect risky activities in Microsoft 365 Copilot</h3>
<p>Security teams need ways to detect risky use of AI applications like deliberate or accidental access to sensitive data, jailbreaks, and copyright violations. Insider Risk Management and Communication Compliance now provide risky AI usage indicators, a policy template, and an analytics report in preview to help detect and investigate the risky use of AI. These new capabilities not only help detect risky activities and prompts but also integrate with Microsoft Defender XDR, enabling your security teams to investigate new AI-related risks holistically alongside other risks, such as identity risks through Microsoft Entra and data oversharing and data loss risks through Purview DLP.</p>
<h3 id="new-microsoft-purview-capabilities-for-agents-built-with-microsoft-copilot-studio">New Microsoft Purview capabilities for agents built with Microsoft Copilot Studio</h3>
<p>When new and citizen developers are building low code or no-code AI, they often lack security expertise and tools to enable security and compliance controls. Microsoft Purview now provides data controls for agents built in Copilot Studio to enable low code and no-code developers to build more secure agents. For example, when an agent built with Copilot Studio accesses sensitive data, it will recognize and honor the sensitivity labels of the data being accessed. Microsoft Purview will also protect sensitive data generated by the agent through label inheritance and will enforce label permissions, ensuring only authorized users have access.</p>
<p>Data security admins also get visibility into the sensitivity of data in user prompts and agent responses within DSPM for AI. Moreover, Microsoft Purview will enable you to detect anomalous user activity and risky or non-compliant AI use and apply retention or deletion policies on your agent prompts and responses.
