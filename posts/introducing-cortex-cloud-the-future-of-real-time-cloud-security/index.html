				<p><em>Cortex® Cloud merges the next version of Prisma® Cloud with best-in-class CDR for real-time cloud security.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Nearly every organization runs in the cloud, driven by promised outcomes, like 65% faster product and service delivery. AI has only accelerated cloud investment, with 63% of top-performing companies citing AI for their decision.</p>
<p>But the cloud comes with risks. Up to 80% of security exposures occur in the cloud, compounded by a recent 66% surge in attacks and the reality that cloud-native risks shift regularly.</p>
<p>Security teams struggle to keep up, facing off against adversaries who appear to thrive​​. One alert, on average, takes 145 hours to resolve. Meanwhile, attackers exploit new vulnerabilities within 15 minutes of disclosure and exfiltrate data in half the time they did last year​​.</p>
<h2 id="peace-time-cloud-security-isnt-enough">Peace-Time Cloud Security Isn&rsquo;t Enough</h2>
<p>Traditional security approaches leave organizations exposed. Posture management has been the foundation of cloud security, helping teams identify misconfigurations and enforce compliance. Security risks, however, don’t stop at misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Organizations need more than “peace time” security. They need real-time prevention.</p>
<h2 id="a-new-approach">A New Approach</h2>
<p>Palo Alto Networks, the pioneer of Code to Cloud™ security, has spent years shaping how organizations protect cloud environments. Prisma Cloud redefined cloud security posture. Cortex transformed AI-driven SecOps. Still, cloud and enterprise security teams remained disconnected, operating in silos with limited visibility, context and response capabilities.</p>
<p>Attackers exploit these gaps – moving between misconfigurations, runtime vulnerabilities and exposed identities faster than teams can respond. The challenges call for change. Palo Alto Networks set out to address them.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-cortex-cloud">Introducing Cortex Cloud</h3>
<p>Cortex Cloud is the next version of Prisma Cloud merged with best-in-class Cortex CDR to deliver real-time cloud security. Built on Cortex, organizations can seamlessly adopt natively integrated capabilities as part of the world’s most complete enterprise-to-cloud SecOps platform.</p>
<p>Security teams gain a context-driven defense that delivers real-time cloud security – continuous protection from code to cloud to SOC. Our new Cloud Runtime Security offering includes the world’s leading CNAPP capabilities at no additional cost, maximizing adoption of end-to-end cloud security on a single platform.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For Prisma Cloud customers, this translates into more power. Your investments are secure, and existing Prisma Cloud customers will experience a seamless upgrade to Cortex Cloud with all the core capabilities you’ve come to expect, enhanced with significant new innovations – including AI-powered prioritization, automated remediation and a new simplified, powerful user experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, once upgraded, Prisma Cloud customers can add Cortex’s industry-leading CDR capabilities as part of the new Cloud Runtime Security offering. Now available on the single Cortex platform, Cortex XSIAM users can seamlessly adopt industry-leading CNAPP, making it the preferred SOC platform for enterprise and cloud.</p>
<h2 id="a-formula-for-results">A Formula for Results</h2>
<p>Breaches happen when security teams can’t connect the dots fast enough. Imagine a world, though, where runtime context informs cloud posture decisions during peace time, ensuring vulnerabilities and other risks are prioritized before they become active threats. Automation then closes the loop on critical issues, resolving risks before attackers exploit them.</p>
<p>At the same time, envision SOC teams with the full picture – seeing not just an attack in progress but the cloud exposures that made it possible. With runtime insights mapped to cloud risk, investigations become faster, more precise and tied to real-world attack paths.</p>
<p>Cortex Cloud changes the equation, setting new benchmarks for simplicity and effectiveness. From smart prioritization that manages millions of security findings to automation that streamlines remediation, organizations can take back control.</p>
<h3 id="unified-data-for-complete-security-intelligence">Unified Data for Complete Security Intelligence</h3>
<p>Security teams aren’t short on data – quite the opposite. Threat indicators get lost in the vast array of cloud telemetry. Cortex Cloud unifies first- and third-party findings into a unified dataplane, eliminating the need to manually connect dispersed insights. Every signal and event is stitched together, giving teams full, real-time context for every decision.</p>
<p>End-to-end visibility allows organizations to reduce investigation times, prioritize what matters and automate responses, whether strengthening security during peace time, such as application development, or responding to real-time incidents under active attack.</p>
<h3 id="ai-and-automation--smarter-detection-faster-response">AI and Automation — Smarter Detection, Faster Response</h3>
<p>With over 7,000 detectors and 2,400+ machine learning models, Cortex Cloud identifies high-risk threats with precision using Cortex XDR’s best-in-class CDR agent, which achieved industry-leading results in the most recent MITRE ATT&amp;CK testing. AI-powered recommendations guide teams toward the fastest resolution, while automation accelerates containment, blocking malicious activity and isolating compromised resources.</p>
<p>Security teams no longer need to navigate disconnected tools and siloed workflows. Out-of-the-box and customizable playbooks orchestrate response workflows, automating fixes where possible and streamlining analyst actions when human oversight is required. As Cortex Cloud continually learns from incidents, automation becomes faster, smarter and more effective, keeping defenders ahead of attackers at every turn.</p>
<h3 id="proven-outcomes-at-scale">Proven Outcomes at Scale</h3>
<p>Cortex Cloud builds on real-world results already achieved by the Cortex platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100% detection coverage</strong> in MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluations, the highest prevention rate among vendors with zero false positives.</li>
<li><strong>90% reduction in MTTR</strong>, often cutting response times from 4 days to under 1–2 hours​​.</li>
<li><strong>75% decrease in analyst workload</strong>, reducing manual tasks and alert fatigue​.</li>
<li><strong>Incident close rates improved from 20% to 100%</strong>, demonstrating the power of unified workflows and AI-driven automation​​.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elevating-cnapps-core-capabilities">Elevating CNAPP’s Core Capabilities</h2>
<h3 id="application-security--fix-issues-at-the-source">Application Security — Fix Issues at the Source</h3>
<p>Security starts in development. Cortex Cloud natively integrates with engineering ecosystems to prevent risks and secure applications by design. The solution unifies leading AppSec tools with newly added third-party scanners for complete code and runtime context to prevent and prioritize risk. Cortex Cloud Application Security centralizes visibility across pipelines and production.</p>
<p>With AI-driven risk prioritization, security teams focus on vulnerabilities and misconfigurations attackers will likely target, while agile security guardrails embed best practices directly into developer workflows. Instead of chasing risks after deployment, organizations achieve protection that scales with growth.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-posture-security--a-connected-view-of-risk">Cloud Posture Security — A Connected View of Risk</h3>
<p>It’s not just about more findings. It’s about contextualized insights that drive action. Yesterday’s cloud security teams worked on posture management without knowing how their configurations affect active threats. They’ve only been able to see theoretical risk. With Cortex Cloud, you can now see real-world attack paths, including whether a vulnerability is actively being exploited in runtime.</p>
<p>Cortex Cloud improves multicloud risk management with new AI-powered prioritization, guided fixes to resolve multiple risks with a single action and automated remediation. Now, you can correlate risks – misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, overly permissive IAM roles, sensitive data exposures – to reveal exploitable attack paths. AI-powered prioritization and Action Plans goes further, grouping related risks with a shared issue, allowing teams to remediate at scale instead of tackling risks one by one. Security teams burn down issues faster, reducing manual workflows by up to 25-fold and resolving multiple risks with a single action.</p>
<p>The fully and tightly integrated solution changes the game for Prisma Cloud customers with a single user experience across CSPM, CIEM, DSPM, AI-SPM, KSPM, ASPM, CWP and vulnerability management – offering complete protection in hybrid and multicloud environments.</p>
