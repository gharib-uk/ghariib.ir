</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automation of Repetitive Tasks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By automating tasks like <strong>code integration</strong>, <strong>testing</strong>, and <strong>deployment</strong>, DevOps removes bottlenecks and speeds up the entire software delivery process. Automation ensures that teams can focus on higher-value tasks while improving the <strong>overall efficiency</strong> of the development pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quick Feedback Loop</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>DevOps encourages rapid testing and feedback through <strong>automated testing</strong> and <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>. With <strong>quick feedback</strong>, developers can identify issues early, fix them, and deploy updated versions faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptability to Changing Needs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
