<p>Scams are big business for cybercriminals, and they’re getting more sophisticated than ever. According to McAfee’s <em>State of the Scamiverse 2025</em> report, the average person encounters 12 scams per day, while Americans see over 14 scam attempts daily, including three deepfake videos.</p>
<p>Fraudsters are leveraging AI-powered tools to create hyper-realistic deepfakes for as little as $5 and 10 minutes, making it harder than ever to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake. The financial impact is staggering—87% of scam victims lose money, with one-third losing over $500, and nearly one in ten losing more than $5,000. </p>
<p>As a parent, one of my greatest concerns is ensuring my family doesn’t fall victim to these evolving scams.</p>
<p>So, here are five key ways to keep your loved ones safe in today’s Scamiverse. </p>
<h2 id="1-always-be-cautiously-suspicious--think-critically--channel-your-inner-sherlock-holmes">1. <strong>Always Be Cautiously Suspicious &amp; Think Critically – Channel Your Inner Sherlock Holmes</strong></h2>
<p>Teaching kids (and adults) to be skeptical of what they see online is a crucial first step in scam prevention. Given the rise of deepfakes and AI-generated frauds, it’s essential to develop a questioning mindset: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Not everyone is who they say they are online.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“If something is too good to be true, it probably is.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“If someone pressures you for money, information, or photos, stop all communication immediately.” </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With detected deepfakes surging tenfold globally and a 1,740% increase in North America alone, it’s more important than ever to show real-world examples of scams to kids and teens so they can recognize the signs. </p>
<h2 id="2-check-your-cyber-hygiene"><strong>2. Check Your Cyber Hygiene</strong></h2>
<p>Good digital habits can prevent many scams before they happen. Yet, 35% of scam victims say falling for a scam caused them moderate to significant distress, highlighting the importance of strong cyber hygiene: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Software Updates: Keep all devices, including gaming consoles, updated. Security patches fix vulnerabilities exploited by scammers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passwords: Use unique passwords for each account. A password manager like McAfee’s TrueKey simplifies this process. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safe Searching: Avoid unsecured websites. Look for ‘https’ in the URL and consider McAfee+, which includes scam protection, identity monitoring, and unlimited VPN access. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App Safety: Download apps only from trusted marketplaces like the App Store or Google Play. Fake banking and finance apps are common scam tactics. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone Calls: With AI-powered voice cloning scams on the rise, never trust unsolicited calls—even if the voice sounds familiar. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-be-careful-what-you-share"><strong>3. Be Careful What You Share</strong></h2>
<p>Cybercriminals use the mosaic effect—piecing together publicly available information—to commit identity theft and financial fraud. Here’s how to lock down your digital footprint: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tighten Privacy Settings: Make all social media profiles private and turn off live location tracking. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware of Random Friend Requests: Many scammers use fake profiles to gain access to personal details. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delay Posting Vacation Photos: AI-powered scams thrive on real-time data. Posting after the fact makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your whereabouts. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-think-before-you-link"><strong>4. Think Before You Link</strong></h2>
<p>Phishing scams remain one of the most successful fraud tactics, often tricking victims into clicking on malicious links. According to McAfee, the most commonly reported scam types include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fake delivery notices (claims of a missed package with a malicious link). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Account verification scams (false claims that your bank or PayPal account needs action). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subscription renewal fraud (phishing attempts pretending to be Netflix, Amazon, or antivirus companies). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To stay safe: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pause Before Clicking: Hover over links to preview their destination. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid Entering Details via Links: Manually type the website into your browser instead. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify with the Sender: If you receive a suspicious link, call the official number rather than responding to the message. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-stay-up-to-date"><strong>5. Stay Up To Date</strong></h2>
<p>Staying informed is one of the best defenses against scams. With social media users sharing over 500,000 deepfakes in 2023, awareness is key. Here’s how to stay ahead: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Follow trusted sources like McAfee’s blog, cybersecurity news sites, and consumer protection agencies. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educate your family—share news about the latest scams and how they work. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report suspicious activity to prevent others from becoming victims. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether it’s deepfake impersonation scams, fraudulent investment schemes, or phishing texts, scammers are evolving rapidly. But with awareness, skepticism, and strong digital habits, you can help ensure your family stays protected from the ever-growing Scamiverse. </p>
