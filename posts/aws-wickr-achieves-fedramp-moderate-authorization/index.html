<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is excited to announce that AWS Wickr has achieved Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) authorization at the Moderate impact level from the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board (JAB).</p>
<p>FedRAMP is a U.S. government–wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services by providing a standardized approach to security and risk assessment for cloud technologies and federal agencies.</p>
<h2 id="customers-find-security-and-control-in-wickr">Customers find security and control in Wickr</h2>
<p>AWS Wickr is an end-to-end encrypted messaging and collaboration service with features designed to help keep your communications secure, private, and compliant. Wickr protects one-to-one and group messaging, voice and video calling, file sharing, screen sharing, and location sharing with 256-bit encryption, and provides data retention capabilities.</p>
<p>Administrative controls allow your AWS Wickr administrators to add, remove, and invite users, and organize them into security groups to manage messaging, calling, security, and federation settings. You can reset passwords and delete profiles remotely, helping you reduce the risk of data exposure stemming from a lost or stolen device.</p>
<p>You can log internal and external communications—including conversations with guest users, contractors, and other partner networks—in a private data store that you manage. This allows you to retain messages and files that are sent to and from your organization, to help meet requirements such as those that fall under the Federal Records Act (FRA) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).</p>
<h2 id="the-fedramp-milestone">The FedRAMP milestone</h2>
<p>In obtaining a FedRAMP Moderate authorization, AWS Wickr has been measured against a set of security controls, procedures, and policies established by the U.S. Federal Government, based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For many federal agencies and organizations, having the ability to securely communicate and share information—whether in an office or out in the field—is key to helping achieve their critical missions. AWS Wickr helps our government customers collaborate securely through messaging, calling, file and screen sharing with end-to-end encryption. The FedRAMP Moderate authorization for Wickr demonstrates our commitment to delivering solutions that give government customers the control and confidence they need to support their sensitive and regulated workloads.” – Christian Hoff, Director, US Federal Civilian &amp; Health at AWS</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="fedramp-on-aws">FedRAMP on AWS</h2>
<p>AWS is continually expanding the scope of our compliance programs to help you use authorized services for sensitive and regulated workloads. We now offer148 services authorized in the AWS US East/West Regions under FedRAMP Moderate authorization, and 128 services authorized in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions under FedRAMP High authorization.</p>
<p>The FedRAMP Moderate authorization of AWS Wickr further validates our commitment at AWS to public-sector customers. With AWS Wickr, you can combine the security of end-to-end encryption with the administrative flexibility you need to secure mission-critical communications, and keep up with recordkeeping requirements. AWS Wickr is available under FedRAMP Moderate in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) Region.</p>
