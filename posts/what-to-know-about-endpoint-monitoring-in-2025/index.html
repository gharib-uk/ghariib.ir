				<p>Today’s workforce is more distributed than ever. Globally, 16% of companies are fully remote, while 40% have a hybrid arrangement. </p>
<p>As workforces become increasingly distributed, security leaders face many challenges. They must monitor potential malicious activity across a wide array of devices scattered throughout the entire network. With the rise of endpoint monitoring tools, it has become easier to monitor devices. But challenges remain.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll go over everything you need to know about endpoint monitoring to improve your organization’s security posture.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-endpoint-monitoring">What is Endpoint Monitoring?</h2>
<p>Endpoint monitoring is the systematic tracking of individual endpoints throughout the organization. By employing unified endpoint management, an organization can collect, aggregate, and analyze user activities regardless of the types of devices or device location. With constant monitoring across the entire network, organizations can help identify potential threats and establish better security policies.</p>
<h2 id="endpoint-monitoring-challenges">Endpoint Monitoring Challenges</h2>
<p>Due to the increase in remote work, endpoint monitoring has become a crucial security measure for organizations. However, organizations need help with monitoring network devices and managing security issues. Most prominently, these challenges include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of devices that need monitoring continues to grow.</li>
<li>Devices are becoming more complex and challenging to manage.</li>
<li>Many organizations need more resources to monitor their endpoints effectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these fundamental challenges, there are several other challenges impeding endpoint security efforts:</p>
<h3 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h3>
<p>Identifying unauthorized access to networks is difficult when there are potentially legitimate endpoints worldwide. That’s what happens with a dispersed workforce. Access management becomes occluded because of many endpoints, including corporate and personal devices.</p>
<p>Modern organizations can thrive by supporting remote work, but security monitoring must occur in a central location to improve response times should a security incident occur on a remote endpoint.</p>
<h3 id="malware-and-ransomware">Malware and Ransomware</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity attacks are on the rise. In 2023, ransomware attacks alone increased by 68 percent. Phishing attacks are more prevalent than ever and more accessible when organizations have many distributed endpoints. All it takes is for one negligent employee to click on the wrong link or a bad actor to crack an individual device, and a modern network could become compromised.</p>
<p>Malware and ransomware attacks can grind an organization to a halt by attacking sensitive systems or putting it at financial or reputational risk by stealing customer data or other valuable assets.</p>
<h3 id="mobile-device-security">Mobile Device Security</h3>
<p>With many distributed endpoints, gaining complete visibility into persistent threats in real time is challenging. Personal devices likely don’t have the same security features as corporate ones, making them more vulnerable to threat actors. Some employees may use the same passwords for personal accounts as professional ones, using the same device to access all of them.</p>
<p>Keeping mobile devices secure is a constant challenge, mainly when remote employees use personal devices for work tasks.</p>
<h3 id="data-loss">Data Loss</h3>
<p>Many high-profile instances have been of companies losing customer data or being subject to a data breach. Not only is there often financial and legal fallout from significant data losses, but there can also be reputational consequences.</p>
<p>While the European Union (EU) has made strides to protect consumer data with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), compliance requirements must be more consistent and well-enforced worldwide. </p>
<p>However, mistakes happen, and an employee not well-versed in data compliance and security may accidentally cause a breach or leak by exfiltrating data somewhere it shouldn’t go. Likewise, a motivated insider threat can harm an organization by exfiltrating or eliminating valuable data.</p>
<h3 id="visibility">Visibility</h3>
<p>Getting complete visibility into an organization may feel impossible, mainly when employees are located worldwide. Visibility is crucial, however, to understand and patch potential security vulnerabilities. Not only that, in the event of a cyber attack or network breach, security leaders need to know how the threat occurred in the first place. Visibility is crucial to stopping persistent threats and identifying potential threats before they play out.</p>
<h3 id="insider-threats">Insider Threats</h3>
<p>Insider threats cause 60% of data breaches. There are plenty of indicators of insider threats. Company insiders may be malicious actors trying to harm the company or gain financially by compromising company systems or data, but insider threats are often unintentional.</p>
<p>Having strong security policies isn’t always enough. Employees need vital security training to understand how their actions may put the company at risk, especially when working from individual endpoints outside the regular company network.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-endpoint-monitoring-and-management-software">What to Look for in Endpoint Monitoring and Management Software</h2>
<p>Endpoint monitoring can be a complex endeavor, which is why leveraging endpoint management software is essential. A comprehensive endpoint monitoring solution can effectively tackle all the challenges we’ve discussed and offer real-time remote monitoring of the entire network, ensuring its health status remains positive. Here’s a detailed look at the features to consider in endpoint management software.</p>
<h3 id="complete-endpoint-visibility">Complete Endpoint Visibility</h3>
<p>Depending on an organization’s size, the network could have hundreds or even thousands of endpoints. You need to monitor more than just a single endpoint. Larger organizations need the status codes of endpoints all over the network, with real-time monitoring for anomaly detection no matter where it may occur.</p>
<p>Deep visibility is the number one consideration when choosing a unified endpoint management tool. After all, what’s the point of an endpoint management solution if you can’t see all endpoints on the network?</p>
<h3 id="endpoint-software-control">Endpoint Software Control</h3>
<p>When a risky situation develops, you need a proactive and comprehensive approach to mitigating it quickly. One of the best ways to do so is with endpoint software control. Some individuals may not realize that a security threat is unfolding before them, and others might be unsure how to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>While many solutions allow security leaders to take over web-based endpoints, endpoint software control gives them remote access to cloud services, software, and more, taking control of an individual endpoint to resolve the problem.</p>
<h3 id="it-asset-management">IT Asset Management</h3>
<p>IT asset management (ITAM) is the end-to-end tracking and management of an organization’s IT assets. This ensures that every asset is used correctly, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of at the end of the lifecycle, keeping organizations compliant and security systems up to date. </p>
<p>A robust endpoint monitoring solution should provide thorough ITAM for all kinds of data and systems within an organization. Maintaining a solid asset management program is critical to preventing future security incidents.</p>
<h3 id="threat-detection">Threat Detection</h3>
<p>You can’t stop a threat before it happens if you don’t detect it first. Real-time threat detection can make all the difference. If someone goes through routine maintenance tasks when their system is attacked, or an insider threat moves to access files, they shouldn’t do so. An effective endpoint monitoring solution should be able to identify a range of security threats before they happen. Once detected, security teams can step in and mediate the issue before it escalates.</p>
<h3 id="reporting-and-alerting">Reporting and Alerting</h3>
<p>Employee monitoring can be a dicey subject for some organizations. Understandably, many employees may not love that their employer watches their every digital move. You don’t have to constantly surveil employees if you set up alert rules and reporting. This task automation saves you from the ignominy of constant surveillance while keeping the organization safe from potential threats. Maintaining employee trust is crucial to building a security culture, so only monitor what you need to.</p>
