<p>As OT environments become more interconnected, organizations can manage operations remotely, enhancing efficiency and enabling greater oversight even from a distance. However, these advancements come with heightened security risks. A recent report from Palo Alto Networks and ABI Research found that 74% of respondents noticed an increase in remote access, creating more entry points for attackers. This expanded attack surface has made OT systems a prime target for cyber threats, underscoring the need for a robust security framework tailored to remote OT environments.</p>
<p>To build a resilient OT security framework, organizations need protections that go well beyond connectivity. Securing all access points, whether cloud-based, on-premises or hybrid, ensures safe and reliable operations in any environment. This comprehensive approach is critical, as 80% of respondents in a recent report believe that cloud technology and other digital tools will be vital to OT over the next three to five years. Without strong security foundations across these access points, organizations face increased risks of operational disruptions, safety incidents and financial losses. Three-quarters of surveyed companies have already encountered these challenges due to OT-targeted cyber-attacks.</p>
<h2 id="core-components-of-a-resilient-ot-security-framework"><strong>Core Components of a Resilient OT Security Framework</strong></h2>
<p>Securing remote OT operations starts with building a foundation of clear visibility into both OT and IT activity so that critical traffic can be effectively monitored and understood. This visibility allows organizations to make informed security decisions, detecting anomalies and responding to potential threats with speed. However, visibility alone is not enough. To create a resilient and layered defense against evolving threats, security must be consistently integrated throughout the network.</p>
<p>By applying the principle of least privilege, organizations can reduce potential security risks by restricting remote access to the minimum necessary for each task. This approach minimizes exposure, limiting each user’s access to essential systems only. Additionally, defining and communicating clear remote access procedures ensures that everyone within the organization understands and follows the same security protocols. Transparent processes are critical for maintaining consistency, especially in complex OT environments where operational safety and continuous uptime are paramount. Ensuring that these protocols support secure, uninterrupted access is essential to keeping critical systems running smoothly.</p>
<p>Establishing secure temporary access is also crucial in OT settings, where unique credentials should be used for each session, and access should be promptly removed once tasks are complete. Temporary connections, whether through VPNs, SSH, or other secure channels, like privileged remote access, must be tightly controlled to prevent unauthorized access. Layering remote access with multi-factor authentication (MFA) offers additional protection, reinforcing security by requiring multiple forms of identity verification before access is granted.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-resilient-access-infrastructure"><strong>Building a Resilient Access Infrastructure</strong></h2>
<p>A resilient security framework for remote OT environments must address the unique conditions and constraints of OT networks, especially where legacy equipment and older operating systems are prevalent. For example, encrypting remote sessions is essential to safeguarding data confidentiality and integrity, particularly for older OT devices that may lack built-in encryption capabilities. However, regular software and firmware updates may not be feasible in systems designed for continuous uptime, safety and availability.</p>
<p>In such cases, compensating controls, like time-limited access, manual authentication processes, or specific verification steps can provide additional security where standard measures are challenging to implement. These controls help maintain secure access without disrupting operational continuity. Similarly, avoiding default configurations and routinely reviewing system settings are crucial steps. Customizing configurations not only addresses specific vulnerabilities but also adapts the security framework to meet the unique demands of OT environments.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-it-and-ot-security-strategies"><strong>Integrating IT and OT Security Strategies</strong></h2>
<p>A robust security framework for remote OT operations requires thoughtful integration of IT and OT practices. Rather than simply adapting IT solutions for OT, a holistic approach that respects the unique demands of OT environments is essential. Designing dedicated workflows that prioritize OT requirements, such as just-in-time access, helps maintain security without hindering operational efficiency.</p>
<p>When IT and OT strategies are aligned with care, the resulting security posture becomes stronger. However, integrating IT best practices with OT networks demands sensitivity to differences, as IT’s rapid update cycles and security protocols may clash with OT’s need for continuous uptime and legacy system stability.</p>
<p>Involving OT personnel directly in remote access planning is also vital. With visibility into upcoming activities, OT teams can respond to incidents effectively, ensuring secure and reliable operations. Education further strengthens this framework by equipping OT teams with the knowledge needed to support security goals and avoid actions that might increase risk.</p>
<h2 id="building-resilience-for-the-future"><strong>Building Resilience for the Future</strong></h2>
<p>Securing remote OT environments is an ongoing process that must evolve alongside technology and emerging threats. A unified security platform provides the adaptability required to meet these changing demands. Such a platform can consolidate capabilities like asset discovery, network segmentation, and advanced threat detection under one system, reducing complexity and streamlining protection across both IT and OT environments.</p>
<p>Automation is another key to resilience, as it allows for adaptive security policies that evolve based on traffic patterns. Automated policy recommendations lower the chance of human error and ensure that protection remains consistent across OT assets. With this framework in place, organizations can focus on creating a secure, efficient environment that enables continuous operations while managing risks in today’s interconnected world.</p>
<p>By prioritizing visibility, proactive threat prevention and the thoughtful integration of IT and OT strategies, organizations can build a resilient framework for remote OT security. This approach not only safeguards critical infrastructure but also prepares companies for the cybersecurity challenges of tomorrow’s connected landscape.</p>
