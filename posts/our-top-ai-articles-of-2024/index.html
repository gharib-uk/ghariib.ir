				<p>As we close out the year, we&rsquo;re rounding up the articles that resonated the most with our readers on Linux, Kubernetes and OpenShift, Ansible automation, programming languages and runtimes, and more. </p>
<p>Love it or hate it, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to gain momentum across industries in 2024. This enthusiasm was reflected on the blog this year, with a focus on building technical skills for learning and working with AI.</p>
<p>This year brought many enhancements to the Red Hat OpenShift AI platform for building AI-enabled applications as well as other new AI solutions. At Red Hat Summit, we announced Podman AI Lab, an extension for Podman Desktop that lets you build, test, and run generative AI-powered applications within containers on a local environment. And in September, there was the general availability release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI, a foundation model platform that makes it easy for users with little to no data science expertise to experiment with large language models. </p>
<h2 id="the-top-10-most-popular-ai-articles-of-2024">The top 10 most popular AI articles of 2024</h2>
<p>Here are this year&rsquo;s most popular articles on AI, featuring an introduction to GPU programming, a guide to integrating AI code assistants, and a look at KServe, an open source project for serving predictive and generative AI models on Kubernetes.</p>
<h3 id="10-introducing-gpu-support-for-podman-ai-lab">#10: Introducing GPU support for Podman AI Lab</h3>
<p>By <strong>Evan Shortiss</strong> and <strong>Cedric Clyburn</strong></p>
<p>GPU accelerated inference can provide significant performance improvements when working with large language models (LLMs). With GPU acceleration, available as of Podman Desktop 1.12, you can harness the power of your local GPU for AI workloads that are deployed in containers. </p>
<p>This article describes how you can inference models faster and build AI-enabled applications with quicker response times using the Podman AI Lab extension with Podman Desktop. </p>

<h3 id="9-how-to-fine-tune-llama-31-with-ray-on-openshift-ai">#9: How to fine-tune Llama 3.1 with Ray on OpenShift AI</h3>
<p>By <strong>Antonin Stefanutti</strong></p>
<p>Learn how to apply supervised fine-tuning to Llama 3.1 models using Ray on Red Hat OpenShift AI. Ray is an industry-leading distributed computing framework, and KubeRay (the Kubernetes operator for Ray) makes it easy to provision resilient and secure Ray clusters that can leverage the compute resources available on your hybrid cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>This how-to article adapts the fine-tuning Llama models with DeepSpeed, Accelerate, and Ray Train example provided by the Ray community to demonstrate how straightforward it is for data scientists to run and scale the Llama 3.1 models’ supervised fine-tuning jobs with OpenShift AI. </p>

<h3 id="8-empower-conversational-ai-at-scale-with-kserve">#8: Empower conversational AI at scale with KServe</h3>
<p>By <strong>Saurabh Agarwal</strong>**,** <strong>Yuan Tang</strong>**, Adam Tetelman, and Rob Esker**</p>
<p>Explore the benefits of KServe, a highly scalable machine learning deployment tool for Kubernetes. It provides a Kubernetes custom resource definition (CRD) for serving machine learning (ML) models on arbitrary frameworks. It aims to solve production model-serving use cases by providing performant, high-abstraction interfaces for common ML frameworks and model formats like TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, and ONNX.</p>

<h3 id="6-open-source-ai-coding-assistance-with-the-granite-models">#6: Open source AI coding assistance with the Granite models</h3>
<p>By <strong>Cedric Clyburn</strong></p>
<p>Developers are always looking for ways to accomplish more without compromising the quality of their code. Tools like GitHub Copilot have gained popularity as AI pair programmers, but the downside is they run on closed models and you might have to pay a subscription to use them. Imagine instead being able to use state-of-the-art free AI coding assistants right on your local machine using powerful open source models.</p>
<p>This article explains how you can integrate an AI code assistant into your IDE using a combination of open source tools, including Continue (an extension for VS Code and JetBrains), Ollama or InstructLab as a local model server, and the Granite family of code models to supercharge your development workflow without any cost or privacy tradeoffs.</p>

<h3 id="5-implement-mlops-with-kubeflow-pipelines">#5: Implement MLOps with Kubeflow Pipelines</h3>
<p>By <strong>Tarcisio Oliveira</strong></p>
<p>MLOps is a set of practices and tools that combines DevOps principles applied to the development cycle of artificial intelligence applications.</p>
<p>Kubeflow Pipelines is an open source platform for implementing MLOps, providing a framework for building, deploying, and managing machine learning workflows in a scalable, repeatable, secure, and cloud-oriented manner on Kubernetes.</p>
<p>With the ability to drive agility and efficiency in the development and deployment of machine learning models, MLOps with Kubeflow Pipelines can also improve collaboration between data scientists and machine learning engineers, ensuring consistency and reliability throughout every step of the workflow.</p>
