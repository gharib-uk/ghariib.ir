<p>DevOps is a set of practices that aims to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). By emphasizing automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement, DevOps ensures that software is delivered faster, more reliably, and with higher quality. DevOps is often structured into four key stages, each playing a vital role in optimizing the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>These four stages—<strong>Plan</strong>, <strong>Develop</strong>, <strong>Build</strong>, and <strong>Monitor</strong>—represent the continuous process of software delivery. By understanding and optimizing these stages, organizations can streamline their development processes and deliver better products to their customers. This post will explore each of these stages in detail, highlighting their major features and importance in the DevOps pipeline.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code Reviews and Quality Assurance</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuous code reviews are conducted to ensure that best practices are followed, reducing bugs and improving overall code quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated testing frameworks like <strong>JUnit</strong> or <strong>Selenium</strong> can be integrated into the development process to continuously validate code as it’s written.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration with CI/CD</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As part of the DevOps cycle, the <strong>Develop</strong> stage is closely tied to Continuous Integration (CI). Developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository to detect issues early in the development process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CI tools like <strong>Jenkins</strong> help automate the process of running unit tests, ensuring that new code does not break existing functionality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-build">3. <strong>Build</strong></h2>
<h3 id="major-features-2">Major Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated Build Processes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Build</strong> stage is responsible for compiling and packaging the code into executable units. This step ensures that the code is ready for deployment and integrates all parts of the application into a single build artifact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automation tools like <strong>Maven</strong>, <strong>Gradle</strong>, and <strong>Docker</strong> ensure that the build process is streamlined, repeatable, and free of errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Integration and Delivery</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In DevOps, the <strong>Build</strong> stage is critical for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). As soon as code is written and committed, the CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building the application, running tests, and deploying it to various environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This stage ensures that software is consistently and reliably delivered to production, with minimal manual intervention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
