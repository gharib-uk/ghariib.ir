<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 18, 2024</p>
<p>Global cybercrime costs are rising rapidly, with estimates reaching $10.5 trillion by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. These financial hits stem from issues like damaged or stolen data, productivity losses, business disruptions, fraud, and the costly aftermath of recovery. The good news? Investing in the right cybersecurity solutions can empower your organization to defend against and recover from cybercrime and other IT-related incidents prevalent in our evolving digital landscape.</p>
<p>The rate of cyber incidents is growing at an alarming pace, and global spending on cybersecurity solutions is following suit. Organizations are allocating more resources than ever to protect their devices, consumers, and operations and are projected to invest $1.75 trillion in cybersecurity from 2021 to 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. To safeguard your own organization, you must understand the solutions necessary to prevent, identify, and recover from threats to physical facilities, devices, virtual systems, and employees.</p>
<p>This is an excerpt from a free 2025 guide to purchasing cyberecurity tools and solutions, published in American City &amp; County, part of Informa TechTarget, which has been the voice of state and local government since 1909.</p>
