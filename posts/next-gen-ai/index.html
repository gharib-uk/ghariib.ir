				<p><em>This is a submission for the 2025 New Year Writing challenge: Predicting 2025.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, seeing the &lsquo;Stargate&rsquo; rollout in the US, it seems that AI is far from stepping off the stage. Instead, we can expect significant developments in the ongoing scenario.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence, fondly known as AI, was first coined in 1956. It has taken decades to reach where we are today, but the next phase or wave of advancements will likely take drastically less time. At this point, we’ve explored the possibilities of AI in nearly every field, and now is the time to start implementing them strategically. It’s like getting comfortable in a car and finally taking it for drifts—&ldquo;the real ride,&rdquo; if you will.</p>
<p>With its sibling technologies like machine learning (ML) and deep learning, data analytics has transformed dramatically. Generative AI has revolutionized multimedia content creation, and AI agents are gradually making their mark, albeit with some serious impact on the job market. This is the present, but what about tomorrow?</p>
<p>In my opinion, computer vision (CV) will co-star in the next big wave. With applications already being built, CV is set to find its way into more sophisticated and everyday uses, thanks to AI. AI tools are already becoming ubiquitous, to the point where drafting a LinkedIn post from scratch feels like a rarity. AI agents will likely be developed more extensively and extravagantly, and AI as a Service (AIaaS) is poised to boom.</p>
<p>AI in automation could be the next big thing—a mammoth application of artificial intelligence. From manufacturing processes to transportation, this development may be a few years away, but it’s certainly in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Deepfakes, though notoriously dangerous, might meet their match with AI-detecting AI. Imagine an original AI telling a deepfake, “You are fake; you’re not real.” While it’s a bit ironic since the AI itself isn’t human, the idea of an &ldquo;AI police force&rdquo; is intriguing.</p>
<p>Speaking of security, AI in cybersecurity hasn’t yet unleashed its full potential. With cybercrimes like digital fraud on the rise, safety-focused AI could take center stage this year. Alongside this, ethical and green AI—though currently more prominent on paper than in practice—may start to gain traction.</p>
<p>Whatever lies ahead, the rise of next-gen AI will undoubtedly be one for the books. However, it’s crucial to remain grounded in this fast-paced era and ensure that AI is powered by us—not the other way around.</p>
