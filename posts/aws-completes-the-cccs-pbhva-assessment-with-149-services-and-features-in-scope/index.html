				<p>We continue to expand the scope of our assurance programs at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and are pleased to announce the successful completion of our first ever Protected B High Value Assets (PBHVA) assessment with 149 assessed services and features. Completion of this assessment effective October 4, 2024, makes AWS the first cloud service provider (CSP) in Canada to meet this high security bar and provide assurance to our valued customers. This assessment also re-affirms our commitment to helping public and commercial customers achieve and maintain the highest-grade security standard for workloads with increased sensitivity.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-pbhva-assessment-and-why-is-it-important">What is the PBHVA assessment and why is it important?</h2>
<p>The Protected B High Value Asset (PBHVA) overlay seeks to enhance the integrity and availability of customer organizational workloads that are considered to have an increased level of sensitivity. These are systems that the Government of Canada (GC) and its service providers use to support delivery of services at a national scale or that are determined to be significant for handling sensitive information. The overlay is a set of 117 controls from the ITSG-33 security control catalogue (baselined against NIST 800-53), which augments the security safeguards to enhance integrity and availability.</p>
<p>As of October 4, 2024, there are a total of 149 AWS services and features that were assessed by the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) under PBHVA assessment criteria. The assessment covers services and features that are available in both the Canada (Central) and Canada West (Calgary) AWS Regions.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-you-access-the-assessment">How can you access the assessment?</h2>
<p>The summary assessment is available through AWS Artifact. You can also learn more about the PBHVA assessment on our AWS PBHVA webpage.</p>
<p>AWS strives to continuously bring services into scope of its compliance programs to help you meet your architectural and regulatory needs. Please reach out to your AWS account team if you have questions or feedback about the PBHVA assessment.</p>
