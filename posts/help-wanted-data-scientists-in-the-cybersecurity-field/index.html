<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Jan. 7, 2025</p>
<p>Data science technology is about to revolutionize even the most traditional industries as it uses AI, Machine Learning, and Big Data, according to a story in Medium.</p>
<p>Total global data storage is projected to exceed 200 zettabytes by 2025, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. This includes data stored on private and public IT infrastructures, on utility infrastructures, on private and public cloud data centers, and personal computing devices; PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and IoT devices</p>
<p>LinkedIn ranks data science among the top 15 emerging professions worldwide.</p>
<p>In the future, there will be a higher need for skilled professionals as businesses increasingly depend on data for decision-making. With advancements in Cloud Computing and Automation tools being used ethically, data scientists will drive innovations in fields such as healthcare, finance, retail, and others.</p>
<p>“We expect to see Help Wanted signs for data scientists specializing in the cybersecurity field over the next few years” says Steve Morgan, founder of Cybersecurity Ventures and Editor-in-Chief at Cybercrime Magazine.</p>
