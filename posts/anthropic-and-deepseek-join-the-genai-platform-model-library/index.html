			<div>
				<p>DigitalOcean’s GenAI Platform continues to expand, making AI-powered development more accessible, flexible, and powerful. Today, we’re excited to announce the availability of Anthropic’s Claude models and DeepSeek R1 into our ecosystem, giving you even more options to build and deploy AI-driven applications.</p>
<p>With Anthropic Claude 3.5 (Sonnet &amp; Haiku), Claude 3 Opus, and DeepSeek R1-distill-llama-70B, you get access to advanced AI options for content generation, real-time interactions, and problem-solving. Beyond serverless inference, meaning that you do not have to manage or provision underlying infrastructure to run AI models, DigitalOcean’s GenAI Platform offers an end-to-end agentic framework with seamless integration and easy deployment. This helps enable you to build AI-driven experiences without infrastructure headaches, paying only for what you use.</p>
<h2 id="say-hello-to-claude-anthropics-state-of-the-art-large-language-models">Say Hello to Claude: Anthropic’s State-of-the-Art Large Language Models</h2>
<p>Anthropic’s Claude models are designed to cater to a variety of enterprise needs, balancing intelligence, speed, and cost. Here’s an overview of the available models:</p>
<p><strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong> – This is the most advanced model in the Claude 3.5 family, offering top-tier performance with improved speed. It’s ideal for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced research and analysis</li>
<li>Complex problem-solving</li>
<li>Sophisticated language understanding and generation</li>
<li>High-level strategic planning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Claude 3.5 Haiku</strong> – This model offers near-instant responsiveness, emulating human interactions. It’s best for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live support chat</li>
<li>Translations</li>
<li>Content moderation</li>
<li>Extracting information from unstructured data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Claude 3 Opus</strong> – This model is designed for strong performance on highly complex tasks, such as mathematics and coding. It’s well-suited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task automation, robust coding, and R&amp;D</li>
<li>Market analysis, forecasting, and strategic decision-making</li>
<li>Advanced chart analysis and financial insights</li>
<li>Brainstorming, hypothesis generation, and drug discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can now integrate Claude models into their GenAI Platform agents by providing their Anthropic API key at setup. Token usage is billed directly to the user’s Anthropic account, while any DigitalOcean resources used (e.g., knowledge bases, functions, guardrails) are billed through their DigitalOcean team account.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b-open-source-power-without-infrastructure-hassle">Introducing DeepSeek R1-distill-llama-70B: Open-Source Power without Infrastructure Hassle</h2>
<p>The DeepSeek R1 model family represents cutting-edge advancements in open-source AI. Released in January, DeepSeek R1 models have made a splash in the AI community, in some instances, even outperforming leading models.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized for reasoning, code, and math tasks</strong> – making it ideal for developers, analysts, and engineers.</li>
<li><strong>Ideal for agent routing</strong> – easy to set up and leverage within the GenAI Platform for task-specific AI agents.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-lingual support</strong> – providing context-aware responses across different languages.</li>
<li><strong>Reasoning transparency</strong> – users can see not just the answer, but also how the model arrived at it.</li>
</ul>
<p>DeepSeek R1-distill-llama-70B is available on the GenAI Platform, and token usage is billed directly through the user’s DigitalOcean account, with no API key needed.</p>
