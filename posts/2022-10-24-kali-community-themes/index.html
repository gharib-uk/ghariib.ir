<p>This past summer we held our first community event on the <a href="https://discord.kali.org/">Kali Linux &amp; Friends</a> Discord. With this event, we asked everyone who wanted to participate to share their Kali Linux setup. With each submission, the community had to select their favorite by adding the <code>:kali4kids:</code> emoji (Shown below). The five submissions with the most <code>:kali4kids:</code> emojis were deemed the winner.</p>

<p>The community has spoken and we are happy to showcase the following setups. The author of each setup has provided us with a little blurb to get to know them a little more, as well as their setup.</p>

<p>I am a senior security consultant working for a large, multinational consulting firm. I conduct pentests in a variety of different fields, and have been working in Android malware analysis for the last year. I hold the OSCP and OSEP certifications, and I will be working towards OSED and OSWE in the near future. I chose this setup for my Kali Linux because I personally prefer a colourful environment that really stands out.</p>
<p>The customization to the terminal comes from the need to reference my IP address for things such as reverse shells or file transfers. You can find a copy of my <code>~/.zshrc</code> on my <a href="https://github.com/purpl3f0xsecur1ty/useful_random_stuff/blob/main/.zshrc">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a French student who likes to tinker and understand how computers work especially on the software side and I’ve been using Kali for about a year and a half.</p>
<p>The program I wrote works by running <code>top</code> to get the list of software running on the session with the RAM and CPU they use and after that a python dependency that is used to generate word clouds is used with a mask of the kali4kids logo to give the shape and colour and this mask is a simple .png file. I made this program because I like to have a wallpaper that I made and also I like minimalist wallpapers and it can be useful. You can find a copy on my <a href="https://github.com/tachyglossues/wallpaper-process-wordcloud">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Hi, I am fume. I have recently graduated from uni and I am working as a penetration tester. Aside from my job, I also like to develop challenges for CTF events. My time sinks are anime, manga, and at times I also play CS:GO.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xct/kali-clean">XCT i3 kali setup script</a> I love Kali Linux, it has always been one of my favourite penetration testing distros. My Kali setup is highly inspired from <a href="https://github.com/xct/kali-clean">xct’s Kali setup</a>, so I use <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/i3-gaps">kali-i3 gaps</a> as my desktop environment with <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/rust-alacritty-terminal">alacritty</a> as my terminal emulator. I use Zsh and have customized it with oh-my-zsh (theme: <code>agnoster</code>). I have done further additions to the i3 bar and have added custom shortcuts in configs to organize my workflow. I am also using <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/ranger">ranger</a> as my command line file manager and <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/btop">btop</a> for rice. A pretty slick thing about ranger is that it also has the same shortcuts as <a href="https://pkg.kali.org/pkg/vim">vim</a>. And yes I believe in vim supremacy :P. Also, I am using megumi’s picture as my wallpaper, the best girl right?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t have scripts or dot-files publicly available for my setup but here are some resources that might help y’all to build a similar/better setup.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/xct/kali-clean">XCT i3 kali setup script</a>
<ul>
<li>I would recommend reading the script and using it as a base but please don’t blindly execute it if you aren’t aware of what you are doing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-S0cWnLBKg">Alex Booker YouTube videos on i3wm:</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Vu7WPkoJo">Luke Smith’s YouTube videos on Ranger and Vim</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to reach out to me on the Kali Linux discord if you have further questions :D</p>

<p>My name is Ahmed and I am 17 years old. I study mathematics and have a passion for cyber security. I am interested in making my own desktop as it encourages me to keep working. I can’t explain it but when you open the computer and find something you made, it inspires you to keep learning more. I don’t have links to share, but anyone can do this so you just have to be a little creative. It was a good competition, thank you for organizing.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I’m Henry. I’m currently a “Cybersecurity Engineer” by day, and a bad PEN-300 student by night (I really need to get those labs done). You might have interacted with me in a Discord livestream, or maybe peeped one of my (admittedly few) walk-through videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFrSJrAxgC86z19u6W1H8Q">YouTube channel</a>. While I am not the greatest among us, I take enjoyment in helping others fulfil their potential and achieve their goals, pentesting or otherwise.</p>
<p>Regarding my build, while I half entered the competition as a joke, I unironically REALLY like the default Kali terminal. The only modification I’ve made is I’ve changed the key bindings of moving between split terminals from “<strong>Alt + Arrow Key</strong>” to “<strong>Shift + Arrow Key</strong>” because the <code>alt</code> movement would break on me from time to time. Outside of just enjoying the default terminal, font, and syntax highlighting, I am used to the default theme, so whether I am on an assessment with a fresh Kali install, looking at a friend’s screen, or helping someone troubleshoot their machine, the terminal looking back at me is almost always a familiar (and pretty) face.</p>
