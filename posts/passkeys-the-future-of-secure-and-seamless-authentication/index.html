				<h2 id="what-are-passkeys">What are passkeys?</h2>
<p>You may have seen the term “passkeys” appearing more frequently in tech news, app updates, and security discussions. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are rolling out passkeys as a replacement for passwords, promising both enhanced security and a smoother user experience. But what exactly are passkeys, and why are they considered the future of authentication?</p>
<p>With Password Day coming up this Saturday, it’s the perfect time to discuss the future of authentication. Passwords have long been the foundation of online security, but they come with significant downsides: they can be stolen, guessed, or reused across multiple sites. Enter passkeys, a next-generation authentication technology designed to replace passwords entirely with a more secure and user-friendly alternative.</p>
<p>Passkeys leverage public-key cryptography to authenticate users without requiring them to remember or type in a password. Instead, passkeys are stored on a trusted device (like your phone, laptop, or tablet) and are accessed using biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint), a PIN, or other device authentication methods. This means <strong>no more passwords to remember, reset, or leak in data breaches</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Check out our recent webinar where we discuss passkeys</strong></p>
<h2 id="how-do-passkeys-work">How do passkeys work?</h2>
<p>Passkeys function using a public and private key pair:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The public key</strong> is stored on the website or service you’re signing into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The private key</strong> stays securely on your device and is never shared.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you log in, the website asks your device to prove that it holds the correct private key. Your device then uses biometric authentication (like Face ID or a fingerprint) to confirm your identity, and the cryptographic exchange verifies you without transmitting a password over the internet. This makes passkeys resistant to <strong>phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks.</strong></p>

<h2 id="pros-of-passkeys">Pros of passkeys</h2>
<p><strong>1. Enhanced security</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No passwords mean no risk of phishing attacks, password leaks, or brute-force attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passkeys are unique for every website, preventing credential reuse across multiple accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resistant to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because private keys are never shared.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Seamless user experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No need to remember or type passwords—simply authenticate with Face ID, a fingerprint, or a PIN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging in is faster and easier, especially on mobile devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Syncs automatically across devices when backed up in Apple iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or Microsoft Account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Built-in multifactor authentication (MFA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traditional MFA often requires entering a one-time passcode (OTP), which can be intercepted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passkeys combine possession (your device) and biometric authentication, making them more secure than passwords + SMS codes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. No centralized password database to hack</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional login systems that store passwords in a database (which hackers can breach), passkeys store only public keys on websites, reducing the risk of massive data breaches.</p>
<p><strong>5. Reduced risk of social engineering</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attackers can’t trick users into revealing passkeys like they do with passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since passkeys are bound to specific websites, even if a hacker creates a fake login page, they won’t be able to use the stolen passkey elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons-of-passkeys">Cons of passkeys</h2>
<p><strong>1. Device dependency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Passkeys are tied to your device, meaning if you lose access to your phone or laptop, you could have trouble logging in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution: Enable cloud backups through iCloud Keychain (Apple), Google Password Manager (Android/Chrome), or Microsoft Account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Not all websites support passkeys yet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While adoption is growing, not every website or service currently supports passkeys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Workaround: You may still need to use passwords for some sites while passkey adoption expands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Migration challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users switching between ecosystems (Apple to Android or vice versa) may need to manually transfer passkeys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution: Some platforms allow exporting and importing passkeys, but it’s not always seamless.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Learning curve for some users</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users unfamiliar with biometrics, password managers, or cryptographic authentication might find passkeys confusing at first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution: Tech companies are working on better onboarding experiences to help ease the transition.Users unfamiliar with biometrics, password managers, or cryptographic authentication might find passkeys confusing at first.</p>

<p>What happens if you lose your phone?</p>
<p>Losing your device when using passkeys can be a concern, but here’s how to handle it:</p>
<p><strong>1. Use a backup device</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve set up passkeys on multiple devices (e.g., phone, tablet, laptop), you can log in using another device.</p>
<p><strong>2. Restore from cloud backup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apple, Google, and Microsoft automatically sync passkeys across devices using their respective cloud services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When setting up a new phone, simply <strong>log into your cloud account</strong> to restore access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Account recovery options</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many services still offer fallback authentication methods, such as email recovery, SMS codes, or backup keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some sites allow you to generate a recovery passkey during setup—store this in a safe place!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Remote device management</strong></p>
<p>If your phone is lost or stolen, use <strong>Find My Device (Apple, Google)</strong> to remotely wipe or lock it to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-consider-switching-to-passkeys">Why you should consider switching to passkeys</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Stronger security than passwords</strong>—no phishing, leaks, or brute-force attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faster logins</strong>—just use your fingerprint or face instead of typing passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No password resets</strong>—forget the frustration of forgetting your credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Growing adoption</strong>—major companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and banks are pushing for passkey implementation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Passkeys represent a significant shift in authentication, making online accounts <strong>more secure and easier to use.</strong> While challenges like device loss and adoption gaps still exist, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried passkeys yet, consider setting them up on a supported website. As more services move toward this passwordless future, early adopters will enjoy enhanced security and convenience while leaving the hassles of passwords behind.</p>
