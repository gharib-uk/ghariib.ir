			<h1>Women’s History Month: Why different perspectives in cybersecurity and AI matter more than ever before</h1>

			<div>
				<p>This Women’s History Month serves as a crucial moment for us to lead and continue to pave the way for a more inclusive future. I am truly honored to support my amazing women colleagues who continue to excel in their careers and am grateful to have so many allies who have extended their hands to help guide and shape me to the person I am today.  </p>
<p>Just last week I was in Tokyo for the Japan Security Forum, where Miki Tsusaka, the President of Microsoft Japan and I had a great conversation during a CyberWomen Asia fireside chat about the importance of women in cybersecurity. Following the chat was a panel discussion with Tsutaki-san, Security leader at Yamaha Motor Corporation and Debbie Furtado, one of our bright Principal group engineering managers. The event highlighted our different perspectives and talents which are invaluable to drive innovation and progress across various industries. I am proud to be a part of Microsoft Security, which is focused on building and nurturing an inclusive cybersecurity workforce and curating careers, tools, and resources that work for everyone. We recognize that this promotes business growth, strengthens global defenses, and enhances AI safety. </p>
<p>According to the World Economic Forum, gender equality in entrepreneurship drives economic growth and innovation.1 McKinsey and Company has also observed that closing the gender gap in employment and entrepreneurship could increase global GDP by 20%, and that organizations with 30% or more women on executive teams are 27% more likely to achieve higher profitability.2  </p>
<p>For a better future we need everyone in the journey and this is particularly of significance in cybersecurity where we face a critical shortage of talent and where cyberthreat actors are from diverse backgrounds.  </p>

<h2 id="addressing-the-skills-gap-in-cybersecurity-and-ai">Addressing the skills gap in cybersecurity and AI</h2>
<p>There is a significant talent gap in cybersecurity. The 2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study reports a global shortage of 4.7 million skilled workers.3 This worker shortage has been a significant challenge the past 12 months and is expected to continue for the next two years. To address this growing concern, we must embrace a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds to foster innovation and find more effective solutions to these challenges.   </p>
<p>By incorporating individuals with varied perspectives, experiences, and approaches within the cybersecurity workforce, we can enhance problem-solving capabilities and enhance strategic defenses.   </p>
<p>Cybercriminals come from various cultures and backgrounds, bringing different perspectives. Security professionals with varied backgrounds and perspectives can provide creative approaches and unique insights to counter these cyberthreats.  Likewise, for AI, having different backgrounds and perspectives help with AI safety and biases. </p>
<h2 id="continue-to-deepen-expertise-and-invite-different-perspectives">Continue to deepen expertise and invite different perspectives</h2>
<p>While progress has been made in creating opportunities for women in cybersecurity, significant work remains to remove entry barriers. It is essential to continue our efforts to improve representation in cybersecurity by creating new pathways and gaining support from more allies. I wholeheartedly encourage you to actively contribute to this objective through the many organizations and programs available and by doing the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Share the accomplishments of meaningful role models with a wide range of experiences and perspectives. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjust job requirements to remove potential biases. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer inclusive training that encourages professionals, particularly those in their early careers, and encourage them to advance their skills in cybersecurity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteer for educational programs that include cybersecurity and AI training. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reach out to community groups that advocate for mentorship opportunities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act as an ally and create opportunities for those interested in cybersecurity careers, such as by encouraging them to participate and speak up and introducing them to peers. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Security should be for all and we are all in this together. Together, we can enhance the global security workforce and contribute to a promising future.  </p>
<p>Register for our upcoming panel “Harnessing Diversity – Strengthening the Cybersecurity Workforce in the Age of AI” and visit Microsoft’s cybersecurity awareness page for resources and training provided by Microsoft security experts, enabling everyone in your organization to become a cyber defender. Let us all acknowledge the importance of diversity in cybersecurity and its critical role in safeguarding our future and shaping a history we can be proud of. </p>
