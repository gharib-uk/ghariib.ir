<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>JetBrains is known for developing some of the world’s most popular IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm. Supporting this development is a dedicated infrastructure team that ensures hundreds of developers can efficiently build, test, and release these products.</p>
<p>At the core of their workflow is TeamCity, JetBrains’ own CI/CD solution, which powers build automation, testing, and scalable infrastructure management.</p>

<p>To understand how TeamCity supports this large-scale development process, we spoke with the IntelliJ Infrastructure team about their approach to managing CI/CD pipelines for 700–800 developers, running thousands of daily builds, and optimizing workflows to deliver fast and reliable releases.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-scaling-cicd-for-hundreds-of-developers">The challenge: scaling CI/CD for hundreds of developers</h2>
<p>With a large team continuously pushing changes, maintaining fast, reliable, and scalable CI/CD pipelines is a complex task. The IntelliJ Infrastructure team requires a solution capable of handling thousands of builds per day without overloading resources while leveraging smart automation to reduce manual effort and ensure high-quality code delivery.</p>
<p>Additionally, their CI/CD setup must support a diverse infrastructure, including on-premises servers, AWS, and macOS, Linux, and Windows agents. Managing hundreds of thousands of automated tests while minimizing flaky test failures is another critical challenge.</p>

<p>To meet these demands, the team relies on TeamCity, JetBrains’ own powerful CI/CD solution, which provides the scalability, flexibility, and automation needed to streamline their development workflows.</p>

<p>“We build IDEs and everything related to them in TeamCity, like internal services, services for statistics, etc. I’m very used to TeamCity and feel like it’s a hammer in my hand: you can do anything with it.”</p></blockquote>
