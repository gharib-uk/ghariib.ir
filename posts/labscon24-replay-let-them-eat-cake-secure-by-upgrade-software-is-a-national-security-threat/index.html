				<p>Kymberlee Price reveals the technical chaos facing SMBs as they struggle with solutions aimed at bigger fish in the face of expanding crimeware.</p>
<p>Ransomware is doing more to change the security landscape than the last 20 years of Secure Development Lifecycle, DevSecOps, Zero Days, Breaches, or any corporate memo. Pair this with predatory pricing models from software vendors that sell security features as add-on products in premium or enterprise tier licenses, and you’ve got a perfect storm that hits small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) the hardest.</p>
<p>In this hard-hitting talk, Kymberlee Price reveals the technical chaos facing the US’s largest employment sector: SMBs. With restricted budgets, a lack of expertise, no access to consumer reports by which to clearly compare products, and a SaaS industry that makes basic security features like SSO a premium add-on, many businesses remain easy pickings for threat actors in a rapidly expanding crimeware landscape.</p>
<p>Why should we care about this, is it really a national threat, and what can a bunch of security engineers do about it?</p>
