				<p>One of the most critical gaps in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they rely on static knowledge already contained within them. Basically, they might be very good at understanding and responding to prompts, but they often fall short in providing current or highly specific information. This is where Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) comes in;  RAG addresses these critical gaps in traditional LLMs by incorporating current and new information that serves as a reliable source of truth for these models. </p>
<p>In our previous blog in this series on understanding and deploying RAG, we walked you through the basics of what this technique is and how it enhances generative AI models by utilizing external knowledge sources such as documents and extensive databases. These external knowledge bases enhance machine learning models for enterprise applications by providing verifiable, up-to-date information that reduces errors, simplifies implementation, and lowers the cost of continuous retraining.</p>
<p>In this second blog of our four-part series on RAG, we will focus on creating a robust enterprise AI infrastructure for RAG systems using open source tooling for your Gen AI project.  This blog will discuss AI infrastructure considerations such as hardware, cloud services, and generative AI software. Additionally, it will highlight a few open source tools designed to accelerate the development of generative AI.</p>
<h1 id="rag-ai-infrastructure-considerations">RAG AI infrastructure considerations</h1>
<p>AI infrastructure encompasses the integrated hardware and software systems created to support AI and machine learning workloads to carry out complex analysis, predictions, and automation. The main challenge when introducing AI in any project is operating the underlying infrastructure stack that supports the models and applications. While similar to regular cloud infrastructures, machine learning tools require a tailored approach to operations to remain reliable and scalable, and the expertise needed for this approach is both difficult to find and expensive to hire. Neglecting proper operations can lead to significant issues for your company, models, and processes, which can seriously damage your image and reputation.</p>
<p>Building a generative AI project, such as a RAG system, requires multiple components and services. Additionally, it’s important to consider the cloud environment for deployment, as well as the choice of operating system and hardware. These factors are crucial for ensuring that the system is scalable, efficient, secure, and cost-effective. The illustration below maps out a full-stack infrastructure delivery of RAG and Gen AI systems:</p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Let’s briefly examine each of these considerations and explore their pros and cons.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>The hardware on which your AI will be deployed is critical. Choosing the right compute options—whether CPUs or GPUs—depends on the specific demands and use cases of your AI workloads. Considerations such as throughput, latency, and the complexity of applications are important; for instance, if your AI requires massive parallel computation and scalable inference, GPUs may be necessary. Additionally, your chosen storage hardware is important, particularly regarding read and write speeds needed for accessing data. Lastly, the network infrastructure should also be carefully considered, especially in terms of workload bandwidth and latency. For example, a low-latency and high-bandwidth network setup is essential for applications like chatbots or search engines</p>
<h2 id="clouds">Clouds</h2>
<p>Cloud infrastructure provides computing power, storage, and scalability, and meets the demands of AI workloads. There are multiple types of cloud environments – including private, public, and bare-metal deployments – and each one has its pros and cons. For example, bare-metal infrastructure offers high performance for computing and complete control over security. However, managing and scaling a bare-metal setup can be challenging. In comparison, public cloud deployments are currently very popular due to their accessibility, but these infrastructures are owned and managed by public cloud providers. Finally, private cloud environments provide enhanced control over data security and privacy compared to public clouds. </p>
<p>The good thing is that you can relatively easily blend these different elements of the cloud together into hybrid cloud environments that offer the pros of each one while covering the flaws that single-environment cloud setups may present.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system">Operating system </h2>
<p>The operating system (OS) plays a crucial role in managing AI workloads, serving as the foundational layer for overseeing hardware and software resources. There are several OS options suitable for running AI workloads, including Linux and enterprise systems like Windows.</p>
<p>Linux is the most widely used OS for AI applications due to its flexibility, stability, and extensive support for machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face. Common distributions used for AI workloads include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and many more. Additionally, Linux environments provide excellent support for containerized setups like docker containers and CNCF-compliant setups like Kubernetes. </p>
<h2 id="gen-ai-services">Gen AI services</h2>
<p>Generative AI projects, such as RAG, may involve multiple components, including a knowledge base, large language models, retrieval systems, generators, inferences, and more. Each of these services will be defined and discussed in greater detail in the upcoming section titled “Advanced RAG and Gen AI Reference Solutions with Open Source.”</p>
<p>While the RAG services may offer different functionalities, it is essential to choose the components that best fit your specific use case. For example, in small-scale RAG deployments, you might need to set aside fine-tuning and early-stage model repositories as these are advanced Gen AI reference solutions. Additionally, it is crucial that all these components integrate smoothly and coherently to create a seamless workflow. This helps reduce latency and accommodates the required throughput for your project.</p>
<h1 id="rag-reference-solution">RAG reference solution</h1>
<p>When a query is made in an AI chatbot, the RAG-based system first retrieves relevant information from a large dataset or knowledge base, and then uses this information to inform and guide the generation of the response. The RAG-based system consists of two key components. The first component is the Retriever, which is responsible for locating relevant pieces of information that can help answer a user query. It searches a database to select the most pertinent information. This information is then provided to the second component, the Generator. The Generator is a large language model that produces the final output.</p>
<p>Before using your RAG-based system, you must first create your knowledge base, which consists of external data that is not included in your LLM training data. This external data can originate from various sources, including documents, databases, and API calls. Most RAG systems utilize an AI technique called model embedding, which converts data into numerical representations and stores it in a vector database. By using an embedding model, you can create a knowledge model that is easily understandable and readily retrievable in the context of AI.  Once you have a knowledge base and a vector database set up, you can now perform your RAG process; here is a conceptual flow:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/canonical/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto,fl_sanitize,c_fill,w_720/https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcJjaB4NVMu351t4KcBKmXgOFHBkkkfdK-m-RGVjhpxEqoieVIDwEkndFijDcorQ2HDTb1Z3HXAMYGao-C_Q9yENvF0_yTk83XyzHR6fQiKLxEY59OqYPeU5TW5m5fmiHaTMIQJ?key=bWiOXP50Qv6mRzi9JmPlbdNX" alt="" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>This conceptual flow follows 5 general steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user enters a prompt or query. </li>
<li>Your Retriever searches for relevant information from a knowledge base. The relevance can be determined using mathematical vector calculations and representations through a vector search and database functionality.</li>
<li>The relevant information is retrieved to provide enhanced context to the generator. </li>
<li>The query and prompts are now enriched with this context and are ready to be augmented for use with a large language model using prompt engineering techniques. The augmented prompt enables the language model to respond accurately to your query. </li>
<li>Finally, the generated text response is delivered to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>RAG can be used in various applications, such as AI chatbots, semantic search, data summarization, and even code generation. The reference solution below outlines how RAG can be combined with advanced generative AI reference architectures to create optimized LLM projects that provide contextual solutions to various Gen AI use cases.</p>
