<h3 id="32-vulnerability-overview">3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW</h3>
<h4 id="321-uncontrolled-search-path-element-cwe-427"><strong>3.2.1</strong> <strong>Uncontrolled Search Path Element CWE-427</strong></h4>
<p>A misconfiguration in lmadmin.exe of FlexNet Publisher versions prior to 2024 R1 (11.19.6.0) allows the OpenSSL configuration file to load from a non-existent directory. An unauthorized, locally authenticated user with low privileges can potentially create the directory and load a specially crafted openssl.conf file leading to the execution of a malicious DLL (Dynamic-Link Library) with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>CVE-2024-2658 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).</p>
<p>A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for CVE-2024-2658. A base score of 8.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N).</p>

<p>General Security Recommendations</p>
<p>Schneider Electric strongly recommends the following industry cybersecurity best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.</li>
<li>Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.</li>
<li>Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the &ldquo;Program&rdquo; mode.</li>
<li>Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.</li>
<li>Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.</li>
<li>Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.</li>
<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.</li>
<li>When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.</p>
<p>CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.</li>
<li>Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolating them from business networks.</li>
<li>When remote access is required, use more secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.<br>
CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>CISA also provides a section for control systems security recommended practices on the ICS webpage on cisa.gov/ics. Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.</p>
<p>CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for proactive defense of ICS assets.</p>
<p>Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at cisa.gov/ics in the technical information paper, ICS-TIP-12-146-01B&ndash;Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies.</p>
<p>Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.</p>
<p>No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported to CISA at this time. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.</p>
