				<p>All the way back in early 2024, Android Authority wrote that in a future update Google Keep might let you jot notes from the lock screen of an Android tablet. The Android 14, Android 14-QPR1, and Android 14-QPR2 release notes mention that the</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>NOTES</code> role in Android 14 supports the note-taking feature and increases productivity of Android tablets. With the <code>NOTES</code> role, OEMs can give the end users a consistent note-taking experience when using a stylus on an Android tablet on the users&rsquo; preferred note-taking app. For more details, see <code>NOTES</code> on Android Roles.</p></blockquote>
<p>While that sounds great, why should this feature be limited to tablets? I believe being able to quickly and easily jot down notes on the go would significantly boost productivity. My Surface Duo supports stylus input. And with the DUO-DE custom ROM, it runs Android 15, so it should be well prepared for a quick test drive, right?</p>
<p>Well. Without any preparations the <em>Default apps</em> settings page looked like this:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fu92rtmvg4ln8d5gbed7y.png" alt="Default apps settings page" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Nothing related to note taking. However, in <em>Developer</em> options, we can force enable the <code>Notes</code> role.</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Once I activated <em>Force enable Notes role</em> and restarted the device a few times, a new entry appeared in <em>Default apps</em>. And, even better, <em>Keep Notes</em> was not only listed but could even be selected as the default notes app:</p>
<p>

</figure>


</p>
<p>The final step is to add a shortcut to the lock screen.</p>

</p>
<p>While it looked like I had set everything up correctly, the lock screen just did not show a <em>Note taking</em> icon. Changing postures had no effect. Neither did tapping on the screen with a stylus help. Being a developer, I was curious to learn what might be going on. But how do we debug system features, particularly if we are not too deep into AOSP internals?</p>
<h3 id="keyguard-quick-affordances">Keyguard Quick Affordances</h3>
<p>The first question that occurred to me was <em>How do these lock screen icons work?</em> Buried deep inside <em>android.googlesource.com</em>, there is a very interesting document titled Keyguard Quick Affordances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To implement a new Quick Affordance, a developer may add a new implementation of <code>KeyguardQuickAffordanceConfig</code> in the <code>packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/keyguard/data/quickaffordance</code> package/directory and add it to the set defined in <code>KeyguardDataQuickAffordanceModule</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, we should find a reference to note taking in <code>packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/keyguard/data/quickaffordance</code>, right? Let&rsquo;s take a look.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Faxhwe8uo5spla2thfmog.png" alt="Contents of directory packages/SystemUI/src/com/android/systemui/keyguard/data/quickaffordance on the main branch" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>While the <code>main</code> branch currently does not contain code related note taking, it apparently did on Jan 19, 2023, until it was merged into <code>tm-qpr-dev</code>.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fi8q9qy1ypbsk0upv0o86.png" alt="Screenshot showing the merged files" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Now, considering these files, can we find out why we can add the <em>Note taking</em> icon but not use the feature in the end?</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F3xg6fnjp1ahopohan24c.png" alt="Source code of NoteTaskModule.kt" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>As far as I understand it, <code>NoteTaskModule</code> decides inside <code>provideIsNoteTaskEnabled()</code> whether to enable note taking or not. Now, given my setup, <code>roleManager.isRoleAvailable(NoteTaskIntentResolver.NOTE_ROLE)</code> should evaluate to <code>true</code>. What about <code>featureFlags.isEnabled(Flags.NOTE_TASKS)</code>? Doing an Android Code Search on <code>Flags.NOTE_TASKS</code> shows this piece of code:</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8oe566hm6bvnvq7pm394.png" alt="Result of an Android Code Search on Flags.NOTE_TASKS" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Invoking <code>releasedFlag()</code> returns an instance of <code>ReleasedFlag</code>, which, according to the documentation, is <code>true</code> by default. If the value is not changed to <code>false</code> at some point, both conditions inside <code>provideIsNoteTaskEnabled()</code> are met. And this kind of makes sense, because kindly recall that I could add the note taking icon in the lock screen settings. It just won&rsquo;t be visible on the lock screen.</p>
<p>Let me mention one more class, NoteTaskIntentResolver. It is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>responsible to query all apps and find one that can handle the <code>ACTION_CREATE_NOTE</code></p></blockquote>
<p>How about taking its code and adding it to an ordinary app? This should simplify debugging. If <em>Google Keep</em> supports the <code>Notes</code> role, it should be returned here, right? Well, let&rsquo;s see.</p>
<p>Here are two slightly adapted versions of <code>resolveIntent()</code> and <code>resolveActivityNameForNotesAction()</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fun resolveIntent(): Intent? {
  val intent = Intent(ACTION_CREATE_NOTE)
  val resolveInfoFlags = ResolveInfoFlags.of(
      PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY.toLong()
  )
  for (info in packageManager.queryIntentActivities(
      intent, resolveInfoFlags
  )) {
      val packageName = 
        info.activityInfo.applicationInfo.packageName
        ?: continue
      val activityName =
        resolveActivityNameForNotesAction(packageName)
        ?: continue
      return Intent(ACTION_CREATE_NOTE)
        .setPackage(packageName)
        .setComponent(ComponentName(packageName, activityName))
        .addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)
  }
  return null
}

private fun resolveActivityNameForNotesAction(
  packageName: String
): String? {
  val intent = Intent(ACTION_CREATE_NOTE).setPackage(packageName)
  val resolveInfoFlags = ResolveInfoFlags.of(
        PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY.toLong()
  )
  packageManager.resolveActivity(
    intent,
    resolveInfoFlags
  )?.activityInfo?.let { activityInfo -&gt;
    if (activityInfo.name.isNullOrBlank()) return null
    if (!activityInfo.exported) return null
    // FLAG_SHOW_WHEN_LOCKED marked as hidden
    if (activityInfo.flags and 0x800000 == 0) return null
    // FLAG_TURN_SCREEN_ON marked as hidden
    if (activityInfo.flags and 0x1000000 == 0) return null
    return activityInfo.name
  }
  return null
}
</code></pre><p>If you want to write a note taking app that can be summoned from the lock screen, <code>resolveActivityNameForNotesAction()</code> nicely tells you how your activity should be configured.</p>
<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h3>
<p>At this point, I hope you are eager to learn if <em>Keep Notes</em> showed up here.</p>
<p>It. Did. Not.</p>
<p>That came as a surprise. Afterwards I checked <em>Standard apps</em> and found out that <em>Keep notes</em> no longer appears to be a candidate for the <code>Notes</code> role. While I don&rsquo;t want to speculate, a reasonable explanation might be that an update (in fact, I received one after I took the screenshots you saw above) deactivated the feature for some devices or device categories. Which would be really sad. As I mentioned at the beginning, limiting the ability to start note taking apps from the lock screen to tablets (or vendors that choose to support it) feels pretty short-sighted. And, no, I don&rsquo;t want to say <em>Hey Gemini, please open the Notes app</em>. I just want a quick way to open that app. Period. For now I consider this a prime example of a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>So, at least on my Surface Duo I can&rsquo;t take notes from the lock screen. Did you have some luck on your device? Please share your thoughts in the comments.</p>
