			<h1>Dell partners with Wind River on modular cloud-native telecommunications infrastructure</h1>

				<p><strong>Dell Technologies,</strong> together with <strong>Wind River</strong> (owned by Intel and Delphi Automotive), is introducing a new telecom cloud infrastructure solution to help communications service providers (CSPs) reduce complexity and accelerate their “<strong>cloud-native”</strong> network deployments.</p>
<p>To facilitate these solutions, <strong>Dell’s telecom partner certification program</strong> simplifies the process for technology partners to validate and integrate their products within a rapidly growing open technology ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks</strong> help accelerate open, cloud-native network deployments.  Dell is taking an entirely new approach to solve the complexities of cloud-native network deployments with Dell Telecom Infrastructure Blocks. The fully engineered, cloud-native infrastructure blocks simplify telecom cloud network deployment and management, while accelerating the introduction of new technologies and lowering operational expenses (OpEX).</p>
<p>As the fastest way to deploy the <strong>Dell Telecom Multicloud Foundation</strong>, launched earlier this year, these blocks include Dell PowerEdge servers, Dell Bare Metal Orchestrator management software, and a CSP’s choice of integrated telecom cloud software platforms, beginning with Wind River Studio.</p>
<p>Dell is the first company to launch a co-engineered system with Wind River, designed and factory integrated to host telecom workloads that can be scaled easily with automation, with streamlined support from Dell for the entire infrastructure stack3. The validated and pre-packaged blocks of hardware and software are designed to meet specific telecom workload requirements and use cases, <strong>spanning the network core to Open RAN Distributed Units (DU) and Centralized Units (CU).</strong></p>
<p>Wind River delivers mature production-ready offerings based on proven Wind River Studio technology, live in deployments with leading operators. Wind River Studio provides the Containers-as-a-Service layer for a distributed cloud and the tools to automate and optimize “Day 2” operations at scale.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said today’s partnership with Wind River is all about making it easier for telecommunications firms to go live on Dell’s hardware and services. “What’s really of note is the new partner self-certification program,” the analyst said. “Partner certification can be slow and is normally always very expensive. So unleashing a self-service process for partners can be a huge accelerator, as long as the quality of the certification is not compromised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Dennis Hoffman, senior vice president and general manager, Dell Technologies Telecom Systems Business:</strong><br>
As the telecom network disaggregates, network operators are challenged to effectively acquire, deploy, test and operate a myriad of open, cloud-native solutions. With our portfolio of software, solutions, development labs and partner programs, including our first open, telecom cloud engineered system with Wind River, a leader in Open RAN deployments, we can partner with communications service providers globally to simplify their transition to cloud-native technologies.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kevin Dallas, president and chief executive officer, Wind River:</strong><br>
Our collaboration with Dell will help address complex CSP challenges in deploying and managing a physically distributed, ultra-low-latency cloud-native infrastructure for intelligent edge networks. As the de facto infrastructure for OpenRAN and 5G vRAN and only 5G solution that is commercially deployed at scale, Wind River Studio enables flexible networks and offers validated architectures to help service providers quickly and reliably deploy new services with industry-leading total cost of ownership for a cloud native future.</p></blockquote>
