				<p>In our daily botnet analysis work, it is common to encounter various loaders.Compared to other types of malware, loaders are unique in that they are mainly used to &ldquo;promote&rdquo;, i.e., download and run other malware on the infected machine. According to our observations, most loaders are proprietary and have a binding relationship with the family they are promoting. A few loader families make themselves into promotion platforms that can spread any other malware family, achieving the so-called malware-as-a-service (MaaS). Compared with proprietary loaders, MaaS types are obviously more dangerous and should be our primary target of concern.</p>
<p>This article introduces a MaaS type loader we saw a while ago, named PureCrypter, which is very active this year, promoting more than 10 other families and using hundreds of C2s. Zscaler has done a detailed sample analysis, this blog mainly introduces the PureCrypter propagation activity we saw from the perspective of C2s and propagation chains to explore the operation of the MaaS type botnet.</p>
<p>The main points of this paper are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>PureCrypter is a loader written in C# that has been around since at least 2021 and can propagate any other family.</li>
<li>PureCrypter continues to be active this year and has propagated more than 10 other malware families including Formbook, SnakeKeylogger, AgentTesla, Redline, AsyncRAT, and others.</li>
<li>PureCrypter authors appears to be resourceful, as we have seen hundreds of C2 domains and IPs.</li>
<li>PureCrypter use image name suffixes combined with inversion, compression and encryption to avoid detection.</li>
<li>PureCrypter has a long propagation chain, and most of them use pre-protectors, some times mixed with other loaders, making detection more difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, the spread of PureCrypter can be summarized in the following figure.</p>
<p>
<figure>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the samples and some typical propagation cases below.</p>
<h1 id="sample-analysis">Sample analysis</h1>
<p>PureCrypter uses the package mechanism, which consists of two executables: downloader and injector, both written in C#, where downloader is responsible for propagating the injector, which releases and runs the final payload.</p>
<p>In practice, the attacker generates downloader and injector through builder, and then will try to propagate downloader, which will download and execute injector on the target machine, and then injector will do the rest of the work. In terms of code logic, the downloader module is relatively simple, with a low level of binary obfuscation and no complex operations such as environment detection and persistence, while injector uses common tricks and techniques seen in popular loaders, such as binary obfuscation, runtime environment detection, starting puppet processes, etc. The following is a brief introduction to downloader and injector combined with actual examples.</p>
<h2 id="downloader-module">downloader module</h2>
<p>This module directly calls WebClient&rsquo;s DownloadData method for HTTP downloads, without setting any HTTP headers.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--11-.png" alt="Image&ndash;11-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>The following is an example of downloading a sample variant with inverted processing, from the parsing code you can see that the HTTP payload is inverted.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--12-.png" alt="Image&ndash;12-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>The inverted PE Header can be found at the end.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--13-.png" alt="Image&ndash;13-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Finally, the recovered data (.DLL file) is loaded by Assembly.Load, and the entry method of plaintext encoding is called to proceed to the next stage.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--14-.png" alt="Image&ndash;14-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>PureCrypter is relatively simple to protect the injector download, so far, in addition to the above mentioned inverted (reverse) encoding, there are also gzip compression, symmetric encryption, etc. This encoding is fixed, that is, the builder has already determined the encoding method when generating the modules of downloader and injector.</p>
<p>The following is an example of using gzip compression and then transferring the injector, and the magic header of gzip can be found at the beginning: <code>1F 8B 08 00</code>.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--15-.png" alt="Image&ndash;15-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>We have also come across examples where AES encryption is used.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--16-.png" alt="Image&ndash;16-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>In addition to AES, PureCrypter also supports DES, RC4 and other encryption algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="injector-module">injector module</h2>
<p>If you analyze the injector samples restored by downloader, you will find that the latter are heavily obfuscated. Here is an example of an injector obfuscated by SmartAssembly and partially encrypted with resources.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--17-.png" alt="Image&ndash;17-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>As shown in the figure above, first the relevant configuration information can be got from the combo of Reverse + GZip + Protubuf.Deserialize; then the runtime environment is checked to fight against sandboxing, with mutexes creation and persistence being done based on the configuration; and finally the payload is read from the resource section for loading. The sample does not enter any if statement, and soon reaches the last important function, which mainly implements the final payload injection. 4 injection methods are supported. While which one to use depends on the configuration, Process Hollowing is the most frequently used one.</p>
<p>

  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/image.png" alt="image" />

</p>
<p>The final payload is stored in the resource.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--18-.png" alt="Image&ndash;18-" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>After reversing and gzip decompression, a puppet process is created to start the final payload.</p>
<p>

  <img src="https://blog.netlab.360.com/content/images/2022/08/Image--19-.png" alt="Image&ndash;19-" />

</p>
<p>The final payload promoted above is AgentTesla, whose configuration information is as follows.</p>

<p>PureCrypter likes to disguise the injector as an image for downloading, the image name is relatively random and has obvious machine generated features. Here are some of the actual detected image names.</p>

<h1 id="c2-and-propagation-analysis">C2 and propagation analysis</h1>
<p>PureCrypter has been active this year, and we have detected more than 200 C2 domains and IPs, and more than 10 propagated families. In the cases we have seen, the propagation chain is generally long, and the downloader module of PureCrypter is often used in conjunction with various other types of predecessor downloaders. Because there are too many C2s, here is an introduction to <code>185.215.113.89</code> as an example in terms of scale and propagation methods.</p>
<h2 id="c2-analysis">C2 analysis</h2>
<p>This C2 is more active than others among the C2s we detected, and its active time is from mid-April to early June this year, as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>Through correlation analysis, we found that <code>185.215.113.89</code> is often used in conjunction with two C2s, <code>62.204.41.69</code> (March) and <code>45.143.201.4</code>(June), and their relationship can be correlated using the chart below.</p>

<h2 id="propagation-analysis">Propagation analysis</h2>
<p>PureCrypter uses the dual module mechanism of downloader+injector, the former is disseminated and then the latter is disseminated, which is equivalent to adding a link to the dissemination chain, plus the author&rsquo;s usual means to hide the objector by means of fake image, encoding transmission, etc., which is complicated enough in itself.</p>
<p>The author also put a lot of effort in the downloader propagation piece, we see the way through the bat2exe bundled crack software, the use of VBS and powershell script loader, combined with Godzilla front loader and many other ways, the result of these operations superimposed is the spread chain is generally deeper and more complex. In May we even found cases of spreading Raccoon through PureCrypter, which further spread Azorult, Remcos, PureMiner, and PureClipper.</p>

<p>PureCrypter is a MaaS type botnet that is still active and has spread more than 10 other families of payloads, with generally complex spreading practices. There might be a fairly big and resourceful team behind it, so it won’t surprised us if they continuously add and spread other malicious families in the future. We will keep an eye on it and share more information when it is needed.</p>
