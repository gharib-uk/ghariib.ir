<p><strong>February 26, 2025</strong>: We’ve updated this post to fix a typo in the code in <strong>Step 5 – Deploy your workload</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Many customers want to seamlessly integrate their on-premises Kubernetes workloads with AWS services, implement hybrid workloads, or migrate to AWS. Previously, a common approach involved creating long-term access keys, which posed security risks and is no longer recommended. While solutions such as Kubernetes secrets vault and third-party options exist, they fail to address the underlying issue effectively.</p>
<p>One option to connect your on-premises Kubernetes workloads to AWS APIs is to use the service account issuer discovery feature. This allows the Kubernetes API server to act as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider and be federated with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). However, this approach requires public internet access to the Kubernetes API server, which might not be desirable for some customers.</p>
<p>To help eliminate the need for long-term access keys or exposing the Kubernetes API server to the public internet, AWS has introduced AWS IAM Roles Anywhere. This feature enables secure, seamless integration of on-premises Kubernetes workloads with AWS services, promoting robust security practices and minimizing potential risks associated with long-term credentials or public exposure.</p>
<p>IAM Roles Anywhere enables workloads outside of AWS to access AWS resources by exchanging X.509 bound identities for temporary AWS credentials. With IAM Roles Anywhere, you can use the same IAM roles and policies as your AWS workloads to access AWS resources, promoting consistency.</p>
<p>IAM Roles Anywhere can be combined with a standard public key infrastructure solution. In this blog post, we use AWS Private Certificate Authority, which has several advantages over using a self-signed certificate authority (CA). First, it reduces operational and management overhead, because AWS manages the CA for you. Second, the cryptographic key material can be stored in hardware security modules or at least vaulted, which helps you protect your private CA against key compromises. Additionally, certificates can be short-lived, which aligns with dynamic Kubernetes environments where pod lifetimes are typically shorter than traditional servers.</p>
<p>We also demonstrate how to integrate IAM Roles Anywhere without modifying your existing workload Docker files, and how to automate the X.509 certificate lifecycle with cert-manager and an AWS Private CA backend in short-lived certificate mode. By using these capabilities, you can seamlessly integrate your on-premises Kubernetes workloads with AWS services, promoting robust security practices, minimizing risks associated with long-term credentials, and helping to ensure a streamlined, consistent access management experience.</p>
<p>This post is for customers who run their own Kubernetes cluster outside of AWS without using Amazon EKS Anywhere. If you’re using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), use IAM roles for service accounts or Amazon EKS Pod Identity instead.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>“Why should I prefer X.509 certificates over IAM access keys?” Access keys are long-term credentials that must be rotated regularly to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. They need to be securely deployed onto servers hosting applications that use them, requiring procedures for secure transfer and deletion of transient copies. As the number of applications and access keys grows, tracking and managing them becomes operationally challenging.</p>
<p>In contrast, X.509 certificates use public key infrastructure (PKI). The private key is generated directly on the application server and doesn’t leave it. Only a certificate signing request, which doesn’t contain secrets, is sent to the CA for signing and returning the certificate. This alleviates the need for securely transmitting secret keys.</p>
<p>However, you can argue that X.509 certificates are also long-lived credentials. This concern is valid, but not necessarily true. As demonstrated by projects such as Let’s Encrypt, it’s possible to reduce certificate lifetimes from years to months by implementing automation for certificate renewal. After such a mechanism is in place, certificate lifetimes can be further limited to days or even hours.</p>
<p>In this post, we introduce mutually authenticated Transport Layer Security (mTLS), which uses certificates for high-assurance bidirectional authentication. Certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server, making sure that both parties are authenticated and authorized to communicate securely. By implementing mTLS, you can achieve a higher level of security and trust in your communication channels, mitigating potential risks associated with unauthorized access or man-in-the-middle attacks. Here, we implement ephemeral certificates that are tied to the lifecycle of pods. When a pod is started, a certificate is automatically created, and it expires after a short period of time unless it’s actively in use by the pod, in which case it’s automatically renewed by the cert-manager. This approach verifies that certificates are only valid for the duration of the pod’s lifetime, minimizing the potential risk associated with long-lived credentials. Additionally, IAM Roles Anywhere supports certificate revocation list (CRL) checks, allowing you to perform explicit revocation of certificates if required. This feature provides an additional layer of security, enabling you to revoke access promptly in case of compromised credentials or other security concerns.</p>
<p>Throughout this post, we assume that you have a basic understanding of IAM Roles Anywhere. For more information you can see this blog post. Furthermore, we assume that you are familiar with Kubernetes, kubectl, Helm, and cert-manager.</p>
<h2 id="solution-overview">Solution overview</h2>
<p>This solution assumes that you have an existing Kubernetes cluster running outside of AWS.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the high-level architecture of our solution. An on-premises Kubernetes cluster accessing AWS APIs using IAM Roles Anywhere with X.509 certificates issued by AWS Private CA in short-lived-certificate mode.</p>
<p>
<figure>

</figure>


</p>
<p>Figure 1: High level architecture of on-premises Kubernetes accessing AWS APIs</p>
<p>Here’s how the solution works, as shown in Figure 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>An AWS Private CA in short-lived certificate mode issues X.509 certificates for your pods.</li>
<li>When you set up your AWS Private CA as a trusted source and establish a specific profile, IAM Roles Anywhere will validate and accept authentication requests that use certificates issued by your AWS Private CA.</li>
<li>cert-manager, deployed into your Kubernetes cluster, orchestrates the issuance of AWS Private CA certificates to authorized pods.</li>
<li>Each pod uses IAM Roles Anywhere to create an AWS session using its private key and X.509 certificate obtained from cert-manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s explore the different parts of the architecture in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="aws-private-ca-short-lived-credentials">AWS Private CA short lived credentials</h3>
<p>AWS Private CA offers a short-lived certificate, where the validity period is limited to 7 days or fewer. You can see this AWS Blog to learn how to use AWS Private CA short-lived certificates. This new mode can be used to issue certificates for your Kubernetes pods and benefit from lower costs of operations. By synchronizing the certificate lifecycle with the lifecycle of the pod, you can minimize the operational overhead for this solution. To help meet requirements for auditability and transparency, you can use the audit report feature to list the issued certificates in a machine readable format.</p>
<h3 id="iam-roles-anywhere">IAM Roles Anywhere</h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows a detailed overview of the components involved in authentication with IAM Roles Anywhere.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2025/01/30/img2-3.png" alt="Figure 2: Components of IAM Roles Anywhere" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Figure 2: Components of IAM Roles Anywhere</p>
<p>IAM Roles Anywhere allows you to obtain temporary security credentials for workloads that run outside of AWS. Your workloads must use a certificate issued by a trusted PKI CA to authenticate with IAM Roles Anywhere. You establish trust between IAM Roles Anywhere and your CA by creating a trust anchor that points to the root of the CA.</p>
<h2 id="cert-manager">cert-manager</h2>
<p>Figure 3 shows a detailed overview of the cert-manager setup used in this post, including the <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> add-on for the integration of AWS Private CA.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2025/01/30/img3-3.png" alt="Figure 3: Detailed overview of cert-manager setup" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Figure 3: Detailed overview of cert-manager setup</p>
<p>cert-manager is a tool for managing X.509 certificates in Kubernetes. As shown in Figure 3, cert-manager will make sure that certificates are valid and up-to-date and attempt to renew them before they expire. By using add-ons, you can configure different backends for issuing X.509 certificates. In this post, we explore how to integrate cert-manager with AWS Private CA using the <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> add-on. The <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> add-on defines two custom resources, <code>AWSPCAIssuer</code> and <code>AWSPCAClusterIssuer</code>, which are used to configure the link to AWS Private CA. They are similar to the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>ClusterIssuer</code> resources that come with cert-manager, but specific to <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code>.</p>
<p>After the <code>AWSPCAIssuer</code> or <code>AWSPCAClusterIssuer</code> is available, <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> authenticates towards AWS APIs using temporary security credentials obtained from IAM Roles Anywhere. cert-manager watches for the certificate resource, which references to an <code>AWSPCAIssuer</code>, which in turn references to AWS Private CA. <code>aws-privatca-issuer</code> requests a certificate from AWS Private CA. The auto-generated private key and the signed certificate are stored in Kubernetes secrets.</p>
<h3 id="using-certificates-and-secrets">Using certificates and secrets</h3>
<p>cert-manager supports multiple ways of integrating into your Kubernetes workloads. You can use certificate resources, which represent a human-readable definition of a certificate signing request (CSR) and contain information on certificate lifespan and renewal time. When using a certificate, the auto-generated private key and the signed certificate are stored in Kubernetes secrets.</p>
<p>With this option, an X.509 certificate is issued manually and saved as a secret. After a PKI is configured as an issuer, a certificate resource is created to automate the renewal of the certificate. With the certificate resource, the lifecycle of certificates is decoupled from the lifecycle of the pods that use them. This allows you to bootstrap the X.509 certificate even before the trusted PKI is deployed.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-csi-driver">Using the CSI driver</h3>
<p>Another way of integrating cert-manager is by using a CSI driver. In this case, the certificate lifecycle is bound to the lifecycle of the pod. An X.509 certificate and private key are mounted into a predefined folder where your workloads can read them. On pod creation, cert-manager automatically creates a private key and requests a certificate for the configured trusted PKI. When the pod is deleted, the private key and certificate are also deleted and become invalid because they aren’t renewed by cert-manager.</p>
<p>In this post, we use the CSI driver approach for workloads to create ephemeral certificates for IAM Roles Anywhere.</p>
<h2 id="workload-configuration">Workload configuration</h2>
<p>Figure 4 shows a detailed view of how pods can be configured to use IAM Roles Anywhere without needing to change the underlying Docker images by using a sidecar that provides an IMDSv2 endpoint that mimics the behavior in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance metadata endpoint.</p>
<p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2025/01/30/img4-3.png" alt="Figure 4: Pod configuration using a sidecar" />
</figure>


</p>
<p>Figure 4: Pod configuration using a sidecar</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 4, when using a certificate resource, the auto-generated private key and the signed certificate are stored in Kubernetes secrets and mounted into the pod. When using the CSI driver, a private key is generated locally (for the pod), a certificate is requested from cert-manager based on the given attributes and is issued by <code>AWSPCAIssuer</code>, and the certificates are mounted directly into the pod with no intermediate secret being created.</p>
<p>IAM Roles Anywhere uses the CreateSession API to authenticate requests with a SigV4a signature using the private key and its associated X.509 certificate. This exchange provides a IAM role session credential, as if you had assumed the IAM role. The aws_signing_helper binary is provided to call the <code>CreateSession</code> API from the command line. In this post, a sidecar container that provides an IMDSv2 endpoint to the workload container is used. This container uses the <code>aws_signing_helper</code> binary and uses its serve command.</p>
<p>This way, applications using AWS SDKs can use the <code>AWS_EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_ENDPOINT</code> environment variable to set the instance metadata endpoint to the correct port on the localhost interface. The X.509 certificate and private key are provided as files to the sidecar container.</p>
<h2 id="solution-deployment">Solution deployment</h2>
<p>In this section, we show the steps needed to deploy the solution in your AWS account.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To deploy the solution in this post, make sure that you have the following in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) v2</li>
<li>An AWS account and IAM permissions for IAM, IAM Roles Anywhere, and AWS Private CA</li>
<li>Latest stable Kubernetes</li>
<li>kubectl (matching your Kubernetes version)</li>
<li>Helm 3</li>
<li>jq</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: As an alternative to using the AWS CLI, you can use the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) service controller for AWS Private CA for creating and managing <code>CertificateAuthority</code>, <code>Certificate</code>, and <code>CertificateAuthorityActivation</code> resources directly within your Kubernetes cluster. After establishing your CA hierarchy using the ACK controller, you can proceed with the subsequent steps involving IAM Roles Anywhere integration, <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code>, and cert-manager as described in this post.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="step-1--aws-private-ca">Step 1 – AWS Private CA</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up a root CA in AWS Private CA, which will issue short lived certificates for your pods. In this example you use only one CA; for production environments, you should check the considerations for designing CA hierarchies. Start by using the AWS CLI to create a configuration.</p>

<p>At this point your root CA is set up and ready to use. The next step is to configure IAM Roles Anywhere.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start by defining a trust anchor that will refer to your newly created AWS Private CA and export the <code>trustAnchorArn</code>. Replace <code>&lt;value-of-trustAnchorArn&gt;</code> with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) value of your IAM Roles Anywhere trust anchor.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws rolesanywhere create-trust-anchor

</code></pre></li>
<li>
<p>Create an IAM role to be used by the <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> cert-manager plugin. This role needs to include the actions <code>sts:AssumeRole</code>, <code>sts:SetSourceIdentity</code> and <code>sts:TagSession</code>, which are required by IAMRA. Replace <code>&lt;TA_ID&gt;</code> with your trust anchor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You should specify a PrincipalTag with the CN. Furthermore, it should be scoped to the IAMRA service principal. This further restricts authorization based on attributes that are extracted from the X.509 certificate and provides an additional layer of security by helping to ensure that even if an unauthorized party gains access to a valid certificate, they cannot assume the role unless the certificate’s CN matches the specified value.</p></blockquote>

<p>The created role <code>iamra-issuer</code> will only be used by the <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> to integrate with AWS Private CA. You should repeat the process of creating IAM roles and IAMRA profiles for your workloads. it’s recommended to create a separate IAM role for each workload and limit its use with condition statements in the trust policy, checking for the workload identity and trust anchor (for example, matching the common name). Furthermore, it’s important that you add IAMRA to the trust policy and allow the aforementioned actions. Best practice with IAM roles is to apply least-privilege permissions.</p>
<h3 id="step-3--create-the-init-container">Step 3 – Create the init container</h3>
<p>To integrate IAM Roles Anywhere within your Kubernetes environment, you need to provide an IMDSv2 endpoint to your application containers by running the <code>aws_signing_helper</code> binary as a sidecar. You also need to configure your applications using an environment variable to use the new instance metadata endpoint. To do so, build a Docker image that works as a sidecar.</p>
<p>In this step, create a basic image that fulfills the preceding requirements. In your environment, you might want to adapt this example to use your own base image and implement your image hardening processes.</p>
<p>Copy the following script and save it as <code>init.sh</code>.</p>

</code></pre><p>This script is the entry point of the sidecar container. It expects the environment variables <code>TRUST_ANCHOR_ARN</code>, <code>PROFILE_ARN</code>, and <code>ROLE_ARN</code>, which are required by <code>aws_signing_helper</code>.

Finally, it invokes the <code>aws_signing_helper</code> with the <code>serve</code> directive which creates an IMDSv2 endpoint listening on 9911 by default. This can be customized using the <code>--port</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Now let’s inspect the Docker file.</p>

<p>In this step, install cert-manager into your cluster and configure <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> using a manually bootstrapped certificate. <code>cert-manager-approver-policy</code> is used to control which certificates can be requested by the workloads. Then, set up the cert-manager CSI driver to automatically provision X.509 certificates for your workload pods.</p>
<p>Start with the cert-manager setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the cert-manager repository to Helm and install the chart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: At the time of writing, we used cert-manager version 1.16.2. Check for the latest stable version.</p></blockquote>

</code></pre><p>Now, install the cert-manager <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> plugin. This integration connects cert-manager with AWS Private CA and lets you issue short-lived certificates automatically. Currently, <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> Helm chart doesn’t support IAMRA natively. So, you’re going to use the same <code>init-container</code> to set up IAMRA as for the workload pods.</p>
<p>You need to issue the first X.509 certificate for <code>aws-privateca-issuer</code> IAMRA manually. Later, cert-manager will renew it automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the bootstrap certificate. When asked for a common name, enter <code>iamra-issuer</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>openssl req -out iamra.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 
-nodes -keyout iamra.key
</code></pre><p>The previous command will create an RSA private key named <code>iamra.key</code> and a certificate signing request name <code>iamra.csr</code>. Now you need to call AWS Private CA to issue the bootstrap certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the validity period of the certificate to 1 day so that cert-manager will replace it after it’s set up. The IAM role that’s performing this action must have permissions to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), IAM, and IAM Roles Anywhere to complete the setup.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>aws acm-pca issue-certificate

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this post, you learned about a solution for securely connecting on-premises Kubernetes workloads to AWS services using IAM Roles Anywhere. The approach alleviates the need for long-term access keys or public internet exposure of the Kubernetes API server. By using this solution for containerized and full stack applications, you can benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced security</strong>: Use short-lived X.509 certificates instead of long-term credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified management</strong>: Automate the certificate lifecycle with cert-manager and AWS Private CA.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless integration</strong>: No modifications are required to existing workload Docker files.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent policies</strong>: Use the same IAM roles and policies across AWS and on premises.</li>
</ul>
