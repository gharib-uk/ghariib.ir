				<p>Organizations today face an unprecedented challenge – managing complex security operations against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats. While internal teams work tirelessly, the sheer scale and complexity of modern threats often exceed their capacity. Advanced security tools are crucial, but they&rsquo;re only part of the solution. What organizations need is a strategic partner, an expert guide to help navigate the intricacies of security operations, identify emerging risks and drive continuous improvement. In this high-stakes environment, success in cybersecurity isn&rsquo;t just about having the right technology; it&rsquo;s about combining tools with expertise to stay ahead of threats and protect critical assets.</p>
<p>To solve this, Palo Alto Networks® is introducing Unit 42® Managed XSIAM, delivering round-the-clock expert defense across all attack surfaces.</p>
<p>This new offering integrates the transformative security operations technology of Cortex® XSIAM® with Unit 42&rsquo;s world-class cybersecurity expertise, creating a solution precisely engineered to tackle modern threats with both accuracy and scale.</p>
<h4 id="unit-42-managed-xsiam-delivers">Unit 42 Managed XSIAM Delivers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Complete visibility across your entire attack surface.</li>
<li>Proactive threat neutralization before damage occurs.</li>
<li>Advanced threat hunting to uncover hidden adversaries.</li>
<li>Continuously refined detection capabilities that adapt to evolving threats.</li>
<li>Accelerated response times to minimize potential impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-challenge--secops-is-not-getting-easier">The Challenge — SecOps Is Not Getting Easier</h2>
<h3 id="overwhelming-complexity">Overwhelming Complexity</h3>
<p>Attacks today are more widespread, impacting various components of an organization’s infrastructure. Unit 42 found that 70% of attacks span three or more attack surfaces, generating telemetry and events across disconnected tools and creating noise. This fragmentation makes it hard for security teams to identify real threats as they require broad expertise to connect and understand events across various domains. This ultimately results in slower threat identification and response times.</p>
<h3 id="reactive-security-operations">Reactive Security Operations</h3>
<p>Many organizations rely on outdated defenses that can&rsquo;t keep pace with today’s fast-moving threats. With attacks progressing from compromise to data exfiltration 3x faster over the last four years, security teams spend most of their time reacting to incidents that have already happened. This leaves little room for proactive threat hunting and risk mitigation, which can result in security gaps as they constantly play catch-up with adversaries.</p>
<h3 id="strained-security-resources">Strained Security Resources</h3>
<p>The demand for specialized threat and engineering expertise is high, but supply is limited and costly. Organizations struggle to recruit and retain talent, leading to security gaps. Internal teams are often stretched thin, juggling continuous monitoring and fine-tuning, which drains resources and leads to burnout and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Addressing these challenges means that organizations need to quickly force multiply and expand their capabilities beyond what is possible in-house.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution--partner-with-experts-that-have-your-back-247">The Solution — Partner with Experts That Have Your Back, 24/7</h2>
<p>Unit 42 Managed XSIAM provides organizations with a partner that enables them to see everything, stop attacks, hunt proactively, adapt detections and respond faster to incidents.</p>

</figure>


</p>
<h3 id="see-everything--zero-touch-data-onboarding-and-optimization">See Everything — Zero Touch Data Onboarding and Optimization</h3>
<p>In nearly 75% of incidents evidence of an attack existed in logs, but siloes and limited visibility-prevented detection. This means that great security starts with great visibility across all data sources.</p>
<p>Unit 42 starts by assessing your unique data sources to ensure adequate coverage for detecting and responding to threats. Once we’ve figured out what data is important, Unit 42 handles data onboarding, mapping and ongoing data maintenance for 1000+ native and third-party integrations within XSIAM. We’ll even help with onboarding custom or unsupported data sources you might have. This ensures you always have comprehensive visibility for effective threat detection and response.</p>
<h3 id="stop-attacks--247-protection-for-all-attack-surfaces">Stop Attacks — 24/7 Protection for All Attack Surfaces</h3>
<p>Adversaries don’t operate in silos and neither does our Managed Detection &amp; Response (MDR) service. The world-renowned Unit 42 team uses over 7,000 detectors and 2,400 BYOML models for 24/7 detection and response across all attack surfaces – cloud, network, identity, email and more. This ensures that no potential threat goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>We’ll also help you optimize your security posture and improve cyber hygiene by identifying risky configurations, tools or other issues in your environment. We’re not just reacting to incidents; we’re helping you avoid them.</p>
<h3 id="hunt-proactively--intelligence-driven-threat-hunting">Hunt Proactively — Intelligence-Driven Threat Hunting</h3>
<p>Unit 42 keeps you ahead of adversaries by harnessing world-class threat intelligence for advanced threat hunting. With threat insights from 500 billion daily events, 30 million+ daily malware samples and visibility across thousands of incidents, our team discovers active threats and continuously refines XSIAM detections and automation.</p>
<p>We also help you understand your unique threat landscape with tailored threat insights and reports informed by a deep understanding of how adversaries operate.</p>
<p>And you’re not just getting whatever threat hunter happens to be available that day – you get designated and experienced threat hunters that become experts in your environment. This allows us to hunt for threats with precision and confidence.</p>
<h3 id="adapt-detections--custom-detection-engineering-for-your-environment">Adapt Detections — Custom Detection Engineering for Your Environment</h3>
<p>Whenever a new threat arises, you can count on Unit 42 to build customized high-fidelity detectors across your data sources. These detectors supplement the already robust XSIAM protections, which provide a 2x faster mean time to detect (MTTD). We handle data-specific correlation rules and mapping to ensure broad coverage against threats.</p>
<p>This continuous detection engineering helps ensure that your SOC is always prepared to handle the latest threats.</p>
<h3 id="respond-faster--automation-fueled-expert-response">Respond Faster — Automation-Fueled Expert Response</h3>
<p>Today’s MDRs can’t scale with manual, limited responses. Unit 42 reduces your overall median time to resolution from days to minutes by rapidly eliminating threats with automation-first response across your entire tech stack, powered by the world’s #1 security automation marketplace.</p>
<p>Unit 42 manages Cortex XSIAM’s diverse marketplace of integrations to operationalize playbooks, enhancing SOC efficiency and performance. This seamless automation management streamlines operations, allowing for swift and coordinated threat response.</p>
<p>Unit 42 also enables rapid and precise response by continuously developing customized advanced playbooks whenever major threats emerge. These playbooks provide a structured and effective approach to threat mitigation, reducing response times and minimizing impact.</p>
<h2 id="outcomes--end-to-end-soc-transformation-that-keeps-getting-better">Outcomes — End-to-End SOC Transformation That Keeps Getting Better</h2>
