<p>Sausalito, Calif. – Dec. 30, 2024</p>
<p>The first event considered to be a ransomware attack happened in 1989, according to CNBC.</p>
<p>A hacker physically mailed floppy disks claiming to contain software that could help determine whether someone was at risk of developing AIDs.</p>
<p>However, when installed, the software would hide directories and encrypt file names on people’s computers after they’d rebooted 90 times.</p>
<p>It would then display a ransom note requesting a cashier’s check to be sent to an address in Panama for a license to restore the files and directories.</p>
<p>The program became known by the cybersecurity community as the “AIDs Trojan.”</p>
<p>Now, 35 years later, as the ransomware industry continues to evolve, experts are predicting hackers will find more and more ways of using the technology to exploit businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>By 2031, ransomware is predicted to cost victims a combined $265 billion annually, according to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures.</p>
