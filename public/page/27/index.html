		<h2 id="the-problem--the-complexity-of-cloud-environments">The Problem — The Complexity of Cloud Environments</h2>
<p>The complex landscape of cloud services, particularly in multi-cloud environments, poses significant security challenges for organizations. Unmanaged cloud resources, human error, misconfigurations and the increasing sophistication of cyber threats, including those from AI-powered applications, create vulnerabilities that can expose sensitive data and disrupt business operations. Organizations are increasingly turning to cloud providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), to address these challenges and power their digital transformation initiatives. However, the vastness of AWS environments and the ease of spinning up new resources and services can lead to cloud sprawl and ongoing security risks.</p>

		<p>A smartphone is often connected to a Wi-Fi network: think of how much time we spend at home, in our office, or even in a public place while studying or exercising. As soon as we can reach a (hopefully trusted) Wi-Fi network, we connect to it!</p>
<p>On Android devices, the Wi-Fi connection is managed by the Wi-Fi service. This service must store information about the previously connected Wi-Fi networks so that the phone can reconnect as soon as it&rsquo;s in the vicinity.</p>

		<p>Docker simplifies containerization by removing runtime complexity and making app development seamless. With Docker Engine v28, we’re taking another step forward in security by ensuring containers aren’t unintentionally accessible from local networks. This update isn’t about fixing a single vulnerability — it’s about security hardening so your containers stay safe. </p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>When you run a container on the default Docker “bridge” network, Docker sets up <strong>NAT (Network Address Translation)</strong> rules using your system’s firewall (via iptables). For example, the following command forwards traffic from port 8080 on your host to port 80 in the container. </p>

		<p>For several years now, the big cloud service providers – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud – have tried to get wireless network operators to run their 5G SA core network, edge computing and various distributed applications on their cloud platforms. For example, Amazon’s AWS public cloud, Microsoft’s Azure for Operators, and Google’s Anthos for Telecom were intended to get network operators to run their core network functions into a hyperscaler cloud.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Observability is critical for web operations to ensure that the application is working as expected and to identify any potential issues. However, setting up observability has traditionally been challenging because it can take hours to set up all the infrastructure, instrument your code and enable observability in production. But now there is a better way using native support for Django in Charmcraft and Rockcraft which has observability built in and ready to go!</p>

		<p>At Cloudflare, we believe that every political candidate — regardless of their affiliation — should be able to run their campaign without the constant worry of cyber attacks. Unfortunately, malicious actors, such as nation-states, financially motivated attackers, and hackers, are often looking to disrupt campaign operations and messaging. These threats have the potential to interfere with the democratic process, weaken public confidence, and cause operational challenges for campaigns of all scales.</p>
