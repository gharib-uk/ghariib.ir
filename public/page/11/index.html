		<p>These Windows features caused some uproar.</p>
<p>This year is Microsoft&rsquo;s 50th anniversary, and many are celebrating its contribution to the tech industry by looking back at some of its iconic operating systems and other achievements. While there&rsquo;s no doubt about the company&rsquo;s impact on the computing world with products like Windows, Microsoft Office, and Xbox gaming, it&rsquo;s had its fair share of misses with products that didn&rsquo;t resonate with customers.</p>

		<p>In 2024, every major European financial service (FS) firm suffered some kind of security breach. These shocking findings come from a study of cyber incidents in Europe last year. It found that 18% of large FS companies suffered direct breaches (where hackers broke into their systems). The rest were exposed through third- or fourth-party breaches […]</p>

		<p>If you’re looking for PDQ Deploy alternatives, you’re either aware of the product’s limitations or exploring your options. As one user puts it: While PDQ Deploy &amp; Inventory consistently meets our needs, the primary driver for exploring alternative solutions was the requirement to manage remote endpoints beyond our on-premises network. This limitation, rather than any […]</p>

In this blog, we take a closer look at a unique infostealer designed to precisely target a narrow data set on systems located in chosen geographic locations.</p>

		<p>Android 14 was released to the public by the Open Handset Alliance on October 4, 2023, and is now available on various smartphones, including the Google Pixel.</p>
<p>This blog post aims to explore a list of the majr oartifacts you can find on this version of the Android OS. </p>
<p>For testing and review, I set up a Google Pixel 7A and used it for about a month, with a SIM card and various native and third-party apps installed.</p>

		<p>This has been a tough year for me: my mom passed away in June, and I&rsquo;m still slowly recovering from the hard blow. It&rsquo;s time to start again doing what I love: researching and sharing!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s early September and like every year, that moment is approaching when everyone who deals with mobile forensics starts to tremble at the thought of the arrival of a new version of iOS!</p>
<p>First the good news: the basic and traditional techniques for logical acquisition (or Advanced Logical, if you want to call it that) still work on iOS 18!</p>

<p>SecureAcademy recently hosted its first-ever Global Cyber Range Challenge, a virtual event designed to provide cyber security students and enthusiasts with real-world, hands-on experience. With participants from 11 countries and 12 academic institutions, the event showcased the power of immersive learning using one of Cyber Park’s gamified experiences to prepare the next generation of cyber defenders. These experiences include Red Team-Blue Team, CTF-style cyber ranges, and introductory escape rooms. The cyber ranges serve as a “flight simulator” for cyber security professionals, providing a gamified, lifelike environment to test and refine their skills.

		<p>Buying a new gaming monitor feels pointless to me</p>
<p>When you hear the term PC upgrades, what do you imagine? — probably a GPU, CPU, SSD, RAM, or motherboard (in that order). At least, that&rsquo;s how I think about PC upgrades. Although I haven&rsquo;t made any major upgrades to my PC in almost 3 years, I never thought about upgrading my monitor in all that time. My existing monitor is an LG 27GL850, a 27&quot; 1440p 144Hz IPS display that I purchased back in 2021.</p>
