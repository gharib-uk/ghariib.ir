	<div>
		<p>Phishing attacks have grown both in volume and in sophistication over recent years. Today’s threat isn’t just about sending out generic emails — bad actors are using advanced phishing techniques like 2 factor monster in the middle (MitM) attacks, QR codes to bypass detection rules, and using artificial intelligence (AI) to craft personalized and targeted phishing messages at scale. Industry organizations such as the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) have shown that phishing incidents continue to climb year over year.</p>

		<p>Strategies to quickly get up to speed, whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned engineer or a newcomer to the field.</p>
<p>The post How GitHub engineers learn new codebases appeared first on The GitHub Blog.</p>
<p>No matter where you are in your coding career, you will likely come across a new codebase or problem domain that is completely unfamiliar to you. Because codebases can be filled with many layers of design patterns, bugfixes, and temporary workarounds, learning a new one can be a time-consuming and frustrating process.</p>

<p>As an indie hacker, I’m always looking for ways to build and launch projects quickly. I had an idea for an AI-powered meal tracking app that could analyze food images and estimate calories, proteins, and other nutrients. But instead of spending months coding everything manually, I wanted to see how much I could leverage AI to accelerate the process.</p>
<p>The goal was simple: launch a functional and monetizable SaaS in record time, with as little manual coding as possible.</p>

<li><strong>Proactive Threat Defense for Financial Institutions</strong>: Trustwave&rsquo;s DbProtect actively identifies sensitive data locations and analyzes potential threat vectors, enabling immediate security measures like enhanced access controls and vulnerability prioritization.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Offensive Security Measures</strong>: Trustwave&rsquo;s offensive security services, including penetration testing and Red Team exercises, simulate real-world cyber threats to expose weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Security Beyond Databases</strong>: Trustwave complements database security with solutions like MailMarshal for phishing protection, user awareness training, and compliance support to safeguard financial institutions from evolving cyber threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial institutions are robbed in innumerable ways. Gunmen conduct physical attacks on bank branches; people commit credit card fraud; hackers attempt to break into ATMs and force them to spit out thousands of dollars, while other threat actors seek to bypass these small-scale incidents and go for millions via a cyberattack.</p>

<p>Digitization has significantly changed manufacturing over the past 25 years. The benefits include reducing inventory costs and machine downtime, and boosting throughput and forecasting accuracy. But as digitization has grown in prevalence, so have the security challenges facing manufacturers. This includes ransomware, legacy systems that are hard to patch, and third-party risk, among other types of threats. At the turn of the 21st century, production facilities were using software in various areas, but these systems were rarely integrated, and departments often operated in silos. Robotic assembly lines were already well established – primarily in the automotive industry – but were […]</p>

		<p>In an era where discovering and rapidly mitigating security vulnerabilities is more important than ever before, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) is at the center of this work. MSRC focuses on investigating vulnerabilities, coordinating their disclosure, and releasing security updates to help protect customers and Microsoft from current and emerging cyberthreats related to security and privacy. MSRC partners with product teams across Microsoft—as well as external security researchers—to investigate reports of security vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft products and services.</p>
