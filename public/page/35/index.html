		<p>Image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) represents an alternative way to build, configure, install, deploy, and manage RHEL. In this tutorial, I will demonstrate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building a bootc container image containing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel and user space using  <code>container-tools</code>.</li>
<li>Using the RHEL 9.5 Boot ISO and a Kickstart file to deploy this RHEL bootc image to a virtual machine (VM).</li>
<li>Managing image mode for RHEL, including how to update, roll back, and switch the image.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="image-mode-for-rhel">Image mode for RHEL</h2>
<p>By using <code>container-tools</code>, a container image is created which includes the RHEL kernel, boot loader, firmware, drivers, and ~440 RPM packages. This RHEL container image (also called RHEL bootc image) can be used to deploy RHEL in the data center or in the cloud, on bare-metal servers, virtual machines, or edge devices.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Have you ever wondered what the Dark Web is? How to access it? Or even better, how to deploy your site to the dark web? Well I got you today. In this article we shall look at how you can deploy your site on the Tor network, which is a Dark web that allows clients and Servers to navigate and exist on the Internet Anonymously.</p>
<p>The Internet is not all you see, it&rsquo;s divided into 2 parts, The Clearnet and The Darknet. They are differentiated by Traceability. You see on the Clearnet, when a message is sent over the network, it&rsquo;s easy to trace the client that sent it and the destination server that it was sent to. That&rsquo;s not the case on the Darknet, on the Darknet the location/IP address of the server and the client are not traceable. The client sends a message to the server but doesn&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s located.</p>

<p>Tax season is a prime time for cybercriminals, especially those running phishing scams to steal W-2s. With many people filing their tax returns, scammers take advantage of the rush to trick unsuspecting individuals into handing over sensitive financial data. This blog highlights the rise in tax-related cybercrime and offers practical tips to keep your information safe.</p>
<p>W-2 phishing scams often involve emails that appear to be from the IRS or another official source, requesting personal information. These phishing emails can be highly sophisticated, often mimicking the look and feel of legitimate communications. The goal is to trick the recipient into revealing confidential data, such as social security numbers and financial information, which the perpetrator can then use for fraudulent purposes. The first step in protecting against such scams is understanding how they work and being able to recognize the red flags.</p>
