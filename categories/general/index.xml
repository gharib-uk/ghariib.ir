      <description>&lt;p&gt;These tools help me monitor and manage my hardware easily and effectively&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of tools you can use to improve your Windows experience, from customizing your desktop to optimizing the performance of your PC. But what if you want to take a closer look at your hardware components and change certain settings or features? I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Windows doesn&amp;rsquo;t give me the level of control I would like, but there are plenty of free apps available that do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Bill Gates puts Intel on blast as he says it &#34;lost its way&#34;&lt;/div&gt;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can anyone blame him, though?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in December 2024, we saw the then-CEO of Intel Pat Gelsinger step down from his position. Intel was on a pretty bad streak of luck at the time, which only just turned around after the company saw success with its Battlemage GPUs. Well, it seems one person had his back at least, as Bill Gates said he had some faith in him during a recent interview.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These console games all deserve remastering for the PC&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While console and PC gaming have evolved side by side for decades, some big franchises have not made the transition to the other platform. That&amp;rsquo;s especially true for the early years of the console wars, and while you could emulate those classic consoles and play the games in their original state, I&amp;rsquo;m all for these classics getting the remaster or reboot treatment so they can come to the PC with the benefits of new graphics technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OLED monitors are excellent, but they&amp;rsquo;re far from perfect&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OLED monitors have become very popular in the last couple of years, especially among gamers, due to all the advantages they offer over traditional LCD panels. I&amp;rsquo;ve owned multiple OLED monitors since 2022, with the Alienware AW3423DW being my very first one. As much as I enjoyed using them, these monitors aren&amp;rsquo;t flawless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You need visibility on what&amp;rsquo;s going on in your home lab at all times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you expand your self-hosted services and home lab with new and varied projects, managing things like uptime and storage space can quickly become a pain. SSHing into individual servers or apps can be a pain, but wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to have a centralized dashboard where you could see, at a glance, the health of your home lab and its services?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notion has over 120 integrations with other platforms and apps. But how many do you actually use?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notion is a powerful all-in-one workspace, boasting over 120 integrations with other platforms and apps. But how many do you actually use? By connecting Notion with other tools, users can expand what’s possible and fill some of the gaps where Notion lacks in functionality. Unfortunately, Notion’s Integration Gallery doesn’t offer much value unless you’re using specific niche platforms. However, there are some meaningful options for everyday users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tired of building NAS, retro gaming systems, and Pi-hole projects with your Raspberry Pi? Here are some useful, lesser-known alternatives&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its huge community of talented tinkerers and avant-garde coders, the Raspberry Pi ecosystem is brimming with useful projects. That said, popular projects like Raspberry Pi NAS, Pi-VPN, and even retro gaming setups can start to feel stale if you’ve been active in the DIY landscape. So, I’ve put together a list of unconventional projects you can build with your tiny tinkering machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This app transformed my knowledge like a wizard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are times when you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re drowning in a sea of information and struggling to connect the dots between ideas, projects, and those random sparks of inspiration. I tried various note-taking and productivity apps, but they did not meet my needs for creating a visual knowledge base. I was starting to think that a good old-fashioned notebook and some highlighters were the best way to keep my thoughts organized. Then I discovered Noteey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Obsbot Meet SE brings high-quality webcams to the masses, and it&amp;rsquo;s probably the one most people should get.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obsbot typically makes pretty high-end webcams and while I usually love them, I always acknowledge they&amp;rsquo;re not for everyone because they&amp;rsquo;re fairly expensive. With the Meet SE, Obsbot wanted to change that perception by introducing the cheapest camera in its lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since it runs without providing access to its underlying operating system, it has inherent security benefits, but it also presents a challenge for security and compliance tools that were not purpose-built to support such an environment. Aqua is a certified security solution for ACA – read on to see how we do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Budget GPUs seemingly have a champion in the Arc B580, if only it didn&amp;rsquo;t tank with budget CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Intel&amp;rsquo;s Arc B580 unveiled the company&amp;rsquo;s new Battlemage architecture over a month ago, it was met with glowing reviews, universally hailed as an affordable 1440p ray tracing GPU. For only $250 (if you could get it at that price), it was comfortable beating the likes of RTX 4060 in almost all titles. Soon after, however, reports started coming in that the Arc B580 had a serious performance overhead issue in the very segment it was targeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be quick to splurge on the RTX 5090&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s GeForce RTX 5090 is the most powerful consumer graphics card you can buy in 2025. One of the main reasons it costs $2,000 is that it has no competition from AMD and Intel. However, even if you can afford to spend that much money on this flagship graphics card, you have to be very careful because there are some important factors to consider before you put it inside your case. Otherwise, you may have to spend even more on additional components to enjoy all the performance gains it brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Turn your old USB flash drive into a secure unlock key for additional PC security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your PC secure these days can be tricky. If you rely solely on a PIN or password, your system is more vulnerable to unwanted access. With Windows Hello integration, which introduces biometric data, things have improved. But if your PC doesn’t offer it, or you want something tangible, you might want another solution. However, you might not want to buy a dedicated security key like a YubiKey or a Thetis FIDO U2F. However, have you considered turning that old USB drive in your drawer into a secure unlock key instead?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be careful when buying; you might snag a fake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After Nvidia released its highly-hyped GeForce RTX 5090 cards, stockists began selling out really quickly. While we hope that at least some of those cards got into the hands of people who will put them to good use, there are some that ended up in the clutches of scalpers. Now, the price of an RTX 5090 has shot up to $9,000 on the second-hand market, and some people are fighting back against the scalpers with fake product listings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next-gen frame generation technologies will unlock next-gen gaming sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nvidia hasn&amp;rsquo;t been shy to talk gaming at 4K with its RTX 40 and RTX 50 series. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 was the most powerful GPU you could buy and the RTX 5090 has since taken that mantle. These graphics cards are great for enjoying all the latest games at 4K with ultra settings configured, though some titles would prove to be too much of a challenge for high frame rates. That&amp;rsquo;s where Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) comes into play. There are various levels to this technology, but it works wonders for high-fidelity gaming and we could see 8K arrive sooner than we think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get rid of Chrome and use these open-source alternatives instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chrome is the most widely used browser, but it’s far from being the best. For one, it’s practically the textbook example of Google’s obsession with collecting private data, tracking nearly everything we do online. While Google has made some recent changes, an advertising company at its core will always find ways to gather customer data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We hardly knew ye.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every so often, Microsoft will remove a pretty useful feature from one of its apps. Sometimes, they evaporate for seemingly no reason, and sometimes, the feature just wasn&amp;rsquo;t seeing enough use to justify continuing its support. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re seeing an example of the latter case: Microsoft has announced that it&amp;rsquo;s sunsetting the Microsoft Defender VPN feature at the end of February. It&amp;rsquo;s a move that&amp;rsquo;s bound to prompt a lot of questions, including &amp;ldquo;When on Earth did Microsoft Defender get a VPN feature?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If so, did you find it particularly convincing or appealing to human nature? If you did, there&amp;rsquo;s a good reason behind it. OpenAI has revealed that, to train some of the most powerful AI models in the world, it simply points it toward a subreddit built solely for argument and debate and lets the training algorithm do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When it comes to the latter option, you&amp;rsquo;re getting a lot of bang for your buck, with the ability to really flesh out your setup without a lot of compromises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the most significant aspects of this evolution is the increasingly sophisticated passcode protection system in iOS devices. This article explores how the delay between failed passcode attempts has evolved over time, highlighting changes that have made iOS screen lock protection more secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-stages&#34;&gt;Early Stages&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of iOS, passcode attempts were practically unlimited. The delay between failed attempts would increase over time, but in extreme cases, the wait time could reach absurd numbers -sometimes even displaying “Next attempt in 100 million years.” There are plenty of screenshots of these exaggerated lockout periods available on the net.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;See which reasons are the only valid ones for upgrading your gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever a new generation of CPUs or GPUs drops, PC users are susceptible to a wave of FOMO clouding their rational thinking. From the announcement livestreams and preview benchmarks to third-party reviews and stock issues, everyone gets swept up in the hype. On the one hand, this is what we look forward to every year or two, but on the other hand, a fancy new product doesn&amp;rsquo;t magically make your existing PC trash.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has introduced a diverse set of features in its latest updates for Excel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of each month, Microsoft publishes a roundup of all the features it added to Excel in the previous four weeks. Now that we are wrapping up the month of January, the Redmond tech firm has detailed all the new capabilities it introduced to its popular spreadsheet software during the first month of 2025. This time around, the company has something in store for Excel customers for Windows, Mac, and the web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pretty lights mean you&amp;rsquo;re torturing your processor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep tabs on your Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s CPU usage, you can always use the built-in tools on your OS or download an app that can give you stats on how it&amp;rsquo;s doing. However, where&amp;rsquo;s the fun in that? Sometimes, the best use of a Raspberry Pi is to replicate what you could already do, but do it even cooler. Such is the case with this Raspberry Pi project that keeps an eye on how your Pi&amp;rsquo;s CPU is doing and uses a light show to communicate how much load it&amp;rsquo;s experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Portainer has your back!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Containers are perfect when you want to isolate your self-hosted services without the extra overhead of virtual machines. While the Docker CLI is the ideal way to manage your containers, running commands for simple operations can get tiresome at times. Docker Desktop is a decent option, but it’s rather rudimentary in its functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Still, variety is the spice of life, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying some forgotten browsers to check out their unique features and design choices, which might surprise you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Storing data in the cloud using free or expensive subscriptions is one thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s a whole different beast to store even more data in the long term. You could use Apple iCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive for all your backups and data you don&amp;rsquo;t need to frequently access, but when working with big data or cold storage, it&amp;rsquo;s best to use a provider with the means to manage files for longer periods and provide the support and software to make your life easier. We&amp;rsquo;ve rounded up some of the best long-term cool and cold storage providers right here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;See why we think Figma is better than Penpot for UX/UI design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UX/UI prototyping tools are becoming some of the most important design software in the modern day. With lives lived with computers in our hands, apps, and responsive web design, we need more design intention than what’s been offered in previous years. With Figma, you can easily design and prototype entire websites, apps, or even presentations and small animated videos. With great power and development, it’s no wonder that Figma rules against its open-source alternative of Penpot. Although Penpot is Figma’s best alternative, the real deal is the better option for UX/UI design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These PC building tasks are laborious, but unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;PC building can be a relatively drama-free affair. It’s never been easier to buy the parts and put them together yourself, but that doesn’t mean it’s always smooth sailing. The more tedious PC building tasks do get easier to deal with as you gain more experience with components, but it doesn’t make them any more enjoyable. These 5 tasks are some of the most difficult, but there are some ways to make them less painful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On a fateful day in June 2022, however, I decided to enter an online PC building contest organized by WD and Nvidia. Like always, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really believe I&amp;rsquo;d win something, but a few weeks later, it became a reality. My tale is 2 years old, but better late than never as they say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need a full NAS to get started sharing files on your home network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all need more and more storage space for our digital files, but you don&amp;rsquo;t always have to dive straight in to a consumer NAS with expensive hard drives. You can take an old SSD or even a flash drive and turn it into a small network drive to get you on your self-storage journey. That&amp;rsquo;s possible because the best Wi-Fi routers have a USB port on them which can be used as a host device for things like USB modems, but also for storage drives. It&amp;rsquo;s also fairly straightforward to enable in your router settings, so let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The handy tool makes it really easy to look up definitions of a word and also powers the software&amp;rsquo;s thesaurus feature to find more ways to express what you&amp;rsquo;re saying. If you get a lot of use out of Smart Lookup, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid to say that Microsoft is now getting rid of it, and you may not like what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>3 reasons Nginx is the best reverse proxy for your NAS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reverse all the proxies with Nginx for your NAS-powered services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Running services on your network-attached storage (NAS) device is one thing but it&amp;rsquo;s a different beast to make these securely available to the outside world with SSL certificates, DDNS, and domain names. That&amp;rsquo;s where handy tools such as Nginx, HAProxy, and Traefik come into play. I&amp;rsquo;ve used HAProxy extensively but recently switched to Nginx for a few reasons. These front-end services will catch incoming traffic and route it accordingly, depending on the configuration, what services you&amp;rsquo;re hosting, and conditions set. Here&amp;rsquo;s why you should consider Nginx when looking at reverse proxies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Breaking bad habits takes effort, but it’s a necessary step toward improving your Photoshop skills&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Photoshop offers endless creative control over your projects, but even experienced users develop bad habits. As a 25-year veteran of Photoshop, I still occasionally catch myself falling back on old habits that I picked up early in my career. Many of these mistakes stem from early learning stages, especially for those who are self-taught users or don’t use Photoshop day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Windows is the most popular desktop operating system, but does that mean it&amp;rsquo;s good for power users? Well, for the most part, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Windows may be the most popular desktop operating system in the world, but it does have a reputation for sometimes being frustrating to use for one reason or another. And with Linux sometimes being brought up by people who are generally more tech-savvy, it begs the question of whether Windows is still a good OS for power users.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be careful where you click.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, it became a &amp;ldquo;life hack&amp;rdquo; to add the word &amp;ldquo;Reddit&amp;rdquo; at the end of a search term for something you want help with (at least, before Google began serving Reddit posts higher than usual). The idea is that whatever problem you have, there are ten Reddit threads from days past that have threads full of troubleshooting tips, advice, solutions, and tools to fix your issue. Well, it seems that the life hack is being used against us, as scammers now use fake Reddit websites to peddle malware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a new drag-and-drop feature, Microsoft wants to make sharing files hassle-free for Windows 11 users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Windows 11 debuted back in 2021, people had mixed feelings about it, because while the design was refreshing, useful features like the drag-and-drop items on the taskbar were missing, leading to outrage. The taskbar drag-and-drop and other missing features were reintroduced to Windows 11 in the 22H2 update. Now, after more than two years, the software giant is once again rolling up its sleeves to take the drag-and-drop to the next level to make sharing effortless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Going direct and getting genuine parts for your favorite consoles should be a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Has the fan seized up inside your game console? How about the display or disc drive? Whenever something goes wrong with a specific part of any video game console, it can be a pain to get it rectified. The most common route is to reach out to the manufacturer, which will require you to either send out the device or seek local assistance from a nearby shop. This can prove time-consuming and costly, depending on whether your console is still under warranty. But what about a classic console? Why don&amp;rsquo;t manufacturers stock and sell parts for all console models?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Make your laptop even better with the right mix of peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of us rely on our laptops for work, school, or entertainment, but even the best laptops trade power and features for the convenience of portability. Gaming laptops come with power-limited GPUs, pretty much all laptops are limited in storage space, and the thinner they get, the harder they are to cool. But with a few wisely chosen pieces of external hardware, that laptop can turn into a powerhouse of productivity and graphical prowess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, when we do, we lose sight of the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; foundation of DIY fans everywhere: Lego blocks. If you&amp;rsquo;re tired of telling yourself that your electronic projects can&amp;rsquo;t use colorful building blocks to house them, then check out this cool example that uses Lego to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Alfred is a complete third-party replacement for Spotlight search. It offers a far more extensible and powerful platform with plenty of configuration, while retaining the same speed, ease of access, and sleek design that Spotlight is known for. While Apple&amp;rsquo;s default Spotlight search is a powerful tool for accessing apps, files, or searching the internet, it pales in comparison to Alfred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Make sure you secure your Raspberry Pi doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like a PC, a Raspberry Pi can also be vulnerable to attacks if it’s not properly secured. Whether using it for personal projects or in a professional setup, as long as you connect it to the internet, it’s vulnerable to attacks. Attackers can exploit a Raspberry Pi, gain unauthorized access, and even compromise the devices connected to the same network. It can also be hijacked and used for malicious activities like botnet operations or for launching denial of service attacks. To stay safe, here are various measures you can take to ensure your Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The company had already been reported to be working on a smaller Surface Pro last year, but plans for that seemingly fell through, as the Surface Pro 11 launched in the same 13-inch size as always.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye on your internet performance using this app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s been working remotely for well over a decade, reliable internet connectivity isn’t just essential — it’s non-negotiable. Whether it’s researching for an article, joining a video call, or catching up on YouTube, inconsistent internet performance can seriously hamper productivity — and leisure. Speed drops, intermittent lags, or latency issues aren’t always consistent; they come and go, making it challenging to hold your internet service provider accountable. In fact, a poor ISP can make investing in the best Wi-Fi routers futile. To address this problem, I’ve been using a Docker-based app to track my internet speed and uptime. Here’s how it worked out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You probably have a lot of games you love on the Game Boy, but have you tried these? Give them a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s Game Boy is an absolutely iconic handheld console that many of us look back on fondly (that&amp;rsquo;s probably why Nintendo is making a Lego version of it). While I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow up with a Game Boy myself, I have played a few games on the platform and I know there&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot to love on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to stay competitive, AMD needs to step it up with these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks have been all about Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s RTX 50 series launch — the company&amp;rsquo;s performance claims, the actual rasterized gen-on-gen gains, and the &amp;ldquo;fake vs. real frames&amp;rdquo; debate. It&amp;rsquo;s also been about the notable absence of AMD&amp;rsquo;s RDNA 4 graphics cards from its CES keynote. The company&amp;rsquo;s RX 9000 GPUs were a no-show at CES, which AMD tried to justify. Many people believe the company might not be confident in its offerings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For some, it&amp;rsquo;s just a basic sound notification; for me, it sends me back to a day when my friends and I were hopping on an audio channel so we could do some 40-man Molten Core raids in World of Warcraft, back when expansions weren&amp;rsquo;t even a thing yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Save our (con)soles&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All my gamer friends have been celebrating ever since Valve announced that they would allow users to install SteamOS on any gaming handheld out there. Understandably so, since SteamOS has a bunch of advantages that can change the world of PC gaming. From being lighter on the internals to allowing users to fire up a game via a custom launcher quickly, SteamOS has quickly established itself as the better alternative to unoptimized Windows 11 builds running on most handhelds on the market. It&amp;rsquo;s also a big reason why the Steam Deck OLED is the best PC gaming handheld at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upgrade your storage with RAM for quick access to important data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself suffering with slower transfer rates when working with lots of data? That&amp;rsquo;s where a RAM disk can come into play. By using available random access memory (RAM) not currently reserved for other software, you can store a substantial amount of data with quick access to the CPU. The fastest PCIe 5.0 drives will offer speeds up to around 16 GB/s, which is nothing to snuff at, but a RAM disk could provide 40 GB/s. That&amp;rsquo;s more than double what the fastest dedicated storage drives will offer and thankfully it&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult to create a RAM disk using Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The eGPU market has been stagnant for years but I believe it&amp;rsquo;s ready to rumble again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When first introduced to the market, external graphics cards or eGPUs were hailed as the savior of gaming on the go, able to increase the graphical power of the best laptops by offloading the processing to the eGPU. While this was a fantastic idea in theory, the practical applications and slower connectivity standards of the time conspired to make them lackluster at best, and the market went stagnant. Most of the eGPU enclosures available now were released years ago, and the manufacturers haven&amp;rsquo;t really been in a rush to release updated versions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2025 is the year your NAS setup gets smarter&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few ways your typical home NAS differs from its enterprise counterpart, most of which have to do with how the NAS holds, processes, and distributes data. Unlike home users, businesses face far more advanced and taxing needs — managing multiple users, applications, and environments. To handle all this complexity, it is crucial for businesses to leverage all the tools at their disposal to maximize the potential of their NAS while ensuring quick accessibility, data safety, and readiness for any data crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It stated that it planned to rebrand its entire productivity line from &amp;ldquo;Microsoft 365 Office&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Microsoft 365 Copilot,&amp;rdquo; and people didn&amp;rsquo;t really gel with the idea.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Intel is the one to watch in the GPU scene.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such an odd time to be an Intel fan. The company continues to struggle with its desktop CPUs but Lunar Lake mobile processors and Arc discrete graphics cards have been largely well received. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Intel&amp;rsquo;s push into the affordable GPU market segment, offering gamers excellent value with Battlemage GPUs for less than $250. The latest addition to the family is the Intel Arc B570, a 1080p and 1440p GPU for $219, seriously undercutting some of the offerings from direct competitors. It&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be a PC gamer as Intel looks to break up the GPU duopoly and here&amp;rsquo;s why these cards will be a sleeper hit for desktop systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crafting a PC with a unique aesthetic might have become harder, but it&amp;rsquo;s not impossible&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ask a PC builder whether they care about performance or looks, and they&amp;rsquo;ll probably answer &amp;ldquo;both.&amp;rdquo; Building a PC that looks unique, however, is easier said than done. Since everyone usually builds with the same overused components, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to craft a PC that stands out. You either end up creating the same fish tank PC as countless others, or an understated black or white-themed build with no RGB.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;x86 has seen setback after setback, and now Arm is looking to capitalize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;x86 has been the primary architecture of PCs and servers over the last few decades, and yet, we&amp;rsquo;re starting to see a tangible shift towards something different. Arm is becoming more and more commonplace, with software vendors finally building their applications for Arm platforms on Windows with the release of the Snapdragon X Elite. Plus, Apple&amp;rsquo;s own shift towards Arm means that an entire segment of mainstream and professional machines are no longer using x86, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Access important notes from any device&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I take notes on my smartphone, laptop, and tablet all the time. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s new ideas for articles or a bug that I experience on a device I&amp;rsquo;m testing, I make it a point to note them down since I tend to forget things quite easily. Apart from storing all my notes in one place for quick referencing, I need to be able to access my notes from all of my devices. Since a lot of users have similar requirements, app stores on all platforms are flooded with note-taking apps that cater to this exact use case. So, deciding which tool to use for taking notes and syncing them across your devices can be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new PC build might involve dozens of things to worry about, but these 6 are not some of them&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Building a PC is often considered to be an &amp;ldquo;adult LEGO&amp;rdquo; activity, but it can sometimes be a tad intimidating, especially for a first-time builder. Even if you manage to get a great PC parts list from a friend, subreddit, or YouTuber, you still need to assemble everything without making mistakes that could cost hundreds of dollars or more to fix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, technology moves fast, and the old adage of &amp;rsquo;leave it alone if it&amp;rsquo;s working&amp;rsquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to BIOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you use a gaming PC with a powerful CPU inside or do most of your gaming on a PC gaming handheld, you&amp;rsquo;ve heard that if your BIOS is working, leave it alone. For the longest time, that was sage advice because BIOS updates ran the risk of bricking the computer, but it&amp;rsquo;s less of a concern with how UEFI BIOS are constructed, and truly bricked devices are rare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s plenty wrong with the gaming industry that needs to be left in the past, where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We love our video games to death, so much so that we&amp;rsquo;re willing to stretch ourselves to buy overpriced GPUs, additional consoles, and way more powerful hardware than we really need, simply to make games look pretty and smooth. What we also love doing (almost as much) is ranting about the things that are wrong with the gaming industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just remember to delete it before you submit your report.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too long ago that we reported on someone who got Tetris working in a PDF document. Of course, the next logical step was to get Doom running on it, which they managed to do. However, it turns out that the story doesn&amp;rsquo;t end there. The feat inspired people to attempt to cram the classic FPS into as many productivity-based apps as possible, and now Microsoft Word has fallen victim to the Doom enthusiasts&amp;rsquo; endless crusade to get it running on everything possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So, when I heard that my favorite modern RPG had gotten Steam Deck verification before its PC debut, you know I had to report on it. If you, too, share my desire to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on the Steam Deck during a cold winter&amp;rsquo;s day, then I have some news for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Pop!_OS may have a strange name, but this distro from System76 promises some of the best gaming performance, thanks to tweaks, a focus on PC games, and support for game launchers out of the box. This also happens to be one of the better choices if you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner to the Linux ecosystem.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AMD has some cool tech on the way for its next-gen GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AMD has found itself in quite the situation. Nvidia continues to dominate the top-end of the GPU market with the $1,999 announcement of the RTX 5090, but the company is also experiencing competition in the lower end from Intel with the new B-series. AMD&amp;rsquo;s RX 7000 series GPUs were solid performers and the RX 7900 XTX was one of my favorites from this most recent GPU generation. However, FSR didn&amp;rsquo;t compete against DLSS and even Intel is using AI for its super sampling tech, so AMD is bringing FSR 4 to the table with next-gen RDNA 4 GPUs, and here&amp;rsquo;s why you should be excited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why pay out big bucks for UI design when you can use this instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sketch and Figma are two of the popular UI/UX design tools out there. While Figma’s free plan feels restrictive, Sketch is an outright paid app. Being a freelancer or a newcomer in the field, the monthly subscription fees for design tools can really put a dent in your budget. That’s where Penpot comes in, which offers a powerful yet affordable solution to anyone who doesn’t compromise on quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If your answer to that is &amp;ldquo;not a lot,&amp;rdquo; then there&amp;rsquo;s some bad news on the horizon. Your monthly bill for using the service is about to go up, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely due to the addition of AI services across the platform. Worst of all, you can&amp;rsquo;t opt out of this price rise, either; everyone is getting hit by it regardless of how much they use (or want) Copilot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

People have devised solutions for the latter path, including third-party apps that will keep the OS secure. However, it seems that people sticking with Windows 10 will also lose Microsoft 365 support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Goodbye, BYOVD attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happy 2025! Microsoft has rolled out the first big updates for Windows 10 and 11 for the year, but don&amp;rsquo;t get too excited. Across the board, we&amp;rsquo;re seeing security fixes for the operating system, which, while very useful for warding off attacks, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really get me excited to give it a spin. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of Roblox, you may notice some issues playing it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;See why I should have nver gotten a Photoshop subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Photoshop has long been hailed as the gold standard for photo editing and digital design, but my experience with its subscription model has not been ideal. While its advanced toolset is undeniably powerful, the steep cost and complexity left me questioning its value and considering Photoshop alternatives. I&amp;rsquo;ll explore why I regret subscribing to Photoshop, highlighting my challenges and frustrations that make it less appealing to those who want affordability and simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ansible may seem a tad overkill for the average user, but it can simplify network management for your home lab&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with wacky projects is one of the biggest perks of a home lab, though spinning up a VM with the same ol’ OS and configuration settings can get tiresome after a while. Thankfully, certain apps like Ansible can make your life a lot easier by helping you automate the tedious virtual machine provisioning process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, you may be weighing whether you should get a NAS or a DAS, and there are pros and cons when it comes to a DAS specifically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Krita hidden features that can boost efficiency and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Krita is a fantastic open-source tool for creative image manipulation. While Krita is one of many alternatives to Photoshop, it stands alone as a go-to creative tool for many digital artists and illustrators, even for digital illustration from tabletstoo. Krita has many obvious tools and features, like layers, brushes, shapes, and selection tools, but it also provides many hidden features you should use to boost your creative workflow further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re self-hosting any services, you&amp;rsquo;ll want a reverse proxy as another layer of defense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once your home network starts getting more complex, like if you were to start self-hosting apps and services, you might want to consider setting up a reverse proxy to shield those services from the internet. This is essentially another server that sits between the device your self-hosted apps are on and the internet, but instead of providing access outward to the internet, it provides access to those apps.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This has been a tough year for me: my mom passed away in June, and I&amp;rsquo;m still slowly recovering from the hard blow. It&amp;rsquo;s time to start again doing what I love: researching and sharing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s early September and like every year, that moment is approaching when everyone who deals with mobile forensics starts to tremble at the thought of the arrival of a new version of iOS!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First the good news: the basic and traditional techniques for logical acquisition (or Advanced Logical, if you want to call it that) still work on iOS 18!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the forensic examination of a smartphone, we sometimes need to understand some basic settings of the device. Some simple examples are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the name of the device?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the &amp;ldquo;Set time automatically&amp;rdquo; option on or off?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is the &amp;ldquo;Set time zone automatically&amp;rdquo; option on or off?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is mobile data switched on or off?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is mobile data roaming switched on or off?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Android devices, most of these settings are managed centrally by the Android settings provider. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the forensic analysis of a mobile device, we often have the need to understand the content of a specific file or folder. This is particularly true when a file or a folder is not parsed by our set of tools. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our approach is, typically, to start googling the file or folder name to check if someone else has already done some researches on it. This approach is time consuming and it&amp;rsquo;s not always easy to quickly find the proper reference. I also realized that I googled the same file/folder name multiple times&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DeepSec 2024 ended on 22 November 2024. We took a week off to post-process the event in terms of video material and dialogues. Usually only participants get first access to the video recordings, but because of the threat of disinformation from nation states, we published the keynote early and freely. Randahl Fink explained his take on manipulation of elections and entire societies. Russia, among others, is very proficient in creating election results that keep on surprising politicians and analysts alike. The Mind Bomb is real, and it is about to explode in Western democracies. You can watch the video online on Randahl’s YouTube channel, his Patreon site, or on our Vimeo account. Presenters at conferences are storytellers. They make topics come alive, create links between seemingly unrelated aspects, teach new knowledge, and hopefully make&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A smartphone is often connected to a Wi-Fi network: think of how much time we spend at home, in our office, or even in a public place while studying or exercising. As soon as we can reach a (hopefully trusted) Wi-Fi network, we connect to it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Android devices, the Wi-Fi connection is managed by the Wi-Fi service. This service must store information about the previously connected Wi-Fi networks so that the phone can reconnect as soon as it&amp;rsquo;s in the vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common question during a forensic investigation of a digital device is: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Has the user ever used the XYZ application?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always when answering this question, it is important to create and follow a solid process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I want to share a possible process that everyone should customize based on their needs and roles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ability to answer the question depends on the acquisition that was obtained from the device. In this blog post, I will address the scenario where you have a full file system acquisition (or physical, for older devices).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fourth episode is dedicated to the most analyzed family of applications: communication and social networking apps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I start, I would like to mention that I have made some corrections to the previous blog post, based on feedback by tool developers. Also, most of them have confirmed to me that they are working on improving their parsing capabilities, based on this blog series. I am happy to support them in that direction!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally back with the third blog post in the series!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I introduce this new post, I want to point out some updates to the previous blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have corrected a couple of errors related to the Belkasoft tool, in particular the device UDID and the device phone number.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, after the blog post, Alexis Brignoni released some new iLEAPP parsers that cover most of the “red” boxes and MSAB confirmed to me that they have already fixed all the “red” boxes from the previous blog post. At the end of the series, I will re-process the dataset with the latest version of the various tools, and create a separate table with the updated comparison.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As explained in the first blog post, I would like to start discussing the acquisition and processing details.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition was done by Josh Hickman using the Cellebrite Premium tool and the result is a Full File System capture in the traditional file format created by UFED.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you open the file EXTRACTION _FFS.zip ZIP you will see that UFED organizes the extracted full file system into 5 subfolders;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;filesystem1&lt;/strong&gt;: extraction of system partition, without the mount point “/private/var/mobile/” (“user data&amp;quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;filesystem2:&lt;/strong&gt; extraction of the mount point for user data (“/private/var/mobile”)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;metadata1:&lt;/strong&gt; metadata for files stored in “filesystem1”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;metadata1:&lt;/strong&gt; metadata for files stored in “filesystem2”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;extra:&lt;/strong&gt; iOS Keychain&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiG-mJRk-eDWqHunSP05m0r4r5fxh2x6RYBI5j-31XBOHCqIBAalhgOJ3IRyiqzagdNZrBIPxh-tUn5cl8W4neBa9opUl3rb2ILlWgEICU18EyYQ7uiNfLVxlJEUKi36-P63eopuOOoBZJVonQ6Rby4lcSY6JHLWHhKr1xt3Zn6172TLxWgAWWX_k2FJko=w640-h228&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up my previous blog post, I decided to create a curated list of iOS Forensics References, organized by folder with specific references (links to blog post, research paper, articles, and so on) for each interesting file. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The list is available as a GitHub repository to make it easier to keep it updated. If you have any proposal for addition in terms of file/folders or a specific reference, please let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to add it to the list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello world, it’s been a while since my last series of blog posts! But now I am ready to share with you the results of my recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I face many different challenges in my daily work as a digital forensics analyst, who deals mainly with mobile devices. &lt;strong&gt;All modern smartphones are encrypted&lt;/strong&gt; (usually with file-based encryption (FBE)), so obtaining or cracking the passcode is required to gain access to all the data stored on the device. And even if we know the passcode (or the user has not set the passcode, which is increasingly rare these days), we still need an exploit to gain “root” access to the device to read and copy all the data and get our “best acquisition”, usually a full file system (FFS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Telegram really an encrypted messaging app?</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/is-telegram-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is reserved for more serious things, and ordinarily I wouldn’t spend time on questions like the above. But much as I’d like to spend my time writing about exciting topics, sometimes the world requires a bit of what Brad Delong calls “Intellectual Garbage Pickup,” namely: correcting wrong, or mostly-wrong ideas that spread unchecked across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is inspired by the recent and concerning news that Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov has been arrested by French authorities for its failure to sufficiently moderate content. While I don’t know the details, the use of criminal charges to coerce social media companies is a pretty worrying escalation, and I hope there’s more to the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a &lt;em&gt;guest&lt;/em&gt; post, where &lt;strong&gt;Andrea Canepa&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;recently&lt;/em&gt; graduated at University of Genoa, Computer Science) will explain his &lt;strong&gt;Master Thesis&lt;/strong&gt;. The topic is &lt;em&gt;how to handle McAfee FDE acquisitions&lt;/em&gt; when doing a DFIR investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you&amp;rsquo;re asked to perform a forensic investigation on a laptop where McAfee FDE is used: the company will provide you the xml file (McAfee ePO) with the decrypting key. How would you proceed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I got asked during presentations and conferences is: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;During a search and seizure we found a wiped iPhone, what can we do next?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6xIfngOuvXrGpaenivhwwqQadArE3RoQ9MynGYodzJ1SjdkoYvo1KOqbz23sL8xmL9t7IAxSgrKELQZZ6NEBRYFJu3wWr1ZxBQOW3lBtjyCq5gtrLgBKemMqluauKuC5lvteSiMW7t1Y/w296-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost: &lt;strong&gt;you cannot recover data stored on the device before wiping occurred&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The encryption keys you need to decrypt the data are gone forever.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Full stop :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are aware of any method, technique, tool or magic box that can do that, please let me know :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in March I was fortunate to spend several days visiting Brussels, where I had a chance to attend a panel on “chat control“: the new content scanning regime being considered by the EU Commission. Among various requirements, this proposed legislation would mandate that &lt;em&gt;client-side scanning&lt;/em&gt; technology be incorporated into encrypted text messaging applications like Signal, WhatsApp and Apple’s iMessage. The scanning tech would examine private messages for certain types of illicit content, including child sexual abuse media (known as CSAM), along with a broad category of textual conversations that constitute “grooming behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So let’s try and reverse the string. I wrote a quick Python script for this, and write the result to a file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The trick is, there are firewall rules that will prevent you from simply running wget, curl, or opening the URL in your favorite web browser. So let’s take a look at the firewall rules:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cat port_20621_rules.txt &#xA;Chain PORT_20621 (1 references)&#xA;target     prot opt source               destination         &#xA;REJECT     tcp  -- anywhere             anywhere             tcp spts:1024:65535 reject-with icmp-admin-prohibited&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what these rules are describing, is that if the source port is in the range of 1024-65535, the packet will be rejected. For those new to networking, every TCP connection has a source port and a destination port. You are likely already aware of common destination port number used for servers, for example, HTTP uses port &lt;code&gt;80&lt;/code&gt; by default. In this challenge, port &lt;code&gt;20621&lt;/code&gt; is the destination port for our HTTP traffic. However, the source port is randomly selected by your client. And because ports under 1024 generally require elevated privellages, most, if not all, programs will never select a port below 1024. However, both &lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; allow you to manually specify the port number. I decided to use &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; because this allowed me to avoid manually building the HTTP GET request. Be sure to run the command with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you have never heard of binwalk, it is a fantastic tool for solving forensics challenges. It goes through files of any type, looking for known magic cookies to help identify when one file type is embedded in another. For example, you may be given an ELF file, that has a jpeg embedded in it, binwalk will be able to find it, assuming the file is not encoded or encrypted in some way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Can they recover deleted emails, contacts and appointments from Microsoft Outlook? Can users erase unwanted correspondence from Outlook? In this article, we’ll demonstrate how experts can recover valuable information from Outlook data files (PST/OST), including deleted emails, contacts, attachments, and appointments. Even when users attempt to erase unwanted correspondence, traces often remain within the database. With the right tools, experts can extract and analyze this hidden data to uncover critical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, many of the questions we are frequently asked are not about the technical stuff but rather the very basics of password recovery. Can you break that password? Is it legal? How much time do you think it will take to break this one? We do have the answers, but they require digging through the extensive content of our blog. To address this, we’ve created a comprehensive A to Z article that not only answers many common questions but also links to our previous posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I ran into a conversation on Twitter about the weaknesses of applied cryptography textbooks, and how they tend to spend way too much time lecturing people about Feistel networks and the boring details of AES. Some of the folks in this conversation suggested that instead of these things, we should be digging into more fundamental topics like “what is a pseudorandom function.” (I’d link to the thread itself, but today’s Twitter is basically a forgetting machine.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Previously, sideloading the extraction agent for imaging the file system and decrypting keychain required enrolling one’s Apple ID into Apple’s paid Developer Program if one used a Windows or Linux PC. Mac users could utilize a regular, non-developer Apple ID. Today, we are bringing this feature to Windows and Linux editions of iOS Forensic Toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there are several different methods achieving essentially the same goal, modern devices (starting with those based on the chip found in the iPhone Xr/Xs) require the use of a special app called extraction agent. On the device, the extraction agent attempts to acquire the required level of privileges by utilizing a chain of exploits, which is an absolute requirement for accessing the root of the file system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in May 2019, along with my colleagues Heather Mahalik and Adrian Leong, we wrote the paper &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Using Apple “Bug Reporting” for forensic purposes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; and some scripts to parse data stored in Sysdiagnose logs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper is still available for download and, for the most part, is still accurate. But time goes on, and new iOS versions have come on the market in recent years. I took a first look at a sysdiagnose generated on a freshly wiped iPhone with iOS 16 natively installed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Add your own personalization to Windows with these free customization tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is your computer just a tool, or is it an expression of yourself? Just like how people once went to extreme lengths to decorate their journals and diaries, you can do the same with your desktop. Programs like Rainmeter have long offered deeper customization options than you might get by default, but Rainmeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t get the love it once did, and it&amp;rsquo;s down to sporadic, few-and-far-between updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Serious savings on a fantastic laptop&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are simply too many laptops to choose from if you&amp;rsquo;re in the market for something new. Of course, we&amp;rsquo;d recommend some of the best laptops available, but if the prices aren&amp;rsquo;t within your budget, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that this one from MSI will be. The Summit E16 AI Studio not only looks good, but also has a large screen and powerful internals as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: extremely wonky cryptography post. Also, possibly stupid and bound for nowhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest problems in applied cryptography (and perhaps all of computer science!) is explaining &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; our tools work the way they do. After all, we’ve been gifted an amazing basket of useful algorithms from those who came before us. Hence it’s perfectly understandable for practitioners to want to take those gifts and simply start to apply them. But sometimes this approach leaves us wondering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we’re doing certain things: in these cases it’s helpful to take a step back and think about what’s actually going on, and perhaps what was in the inventors’ heads when the tools were first invented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post continues a long, wonky discussion of Schnorr signature schemes and the Dilithium post-quantum signature. You may want to start with Part 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the previous post I discussed the intuition behind Schnorr signatures, beginning with a high-level design rationale and ending with a concrete instantiation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: our discussion began with this Tweet by Chris Peikert:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/schnorrpeikert.png?w=1024&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which we eventually developed into an abstract version of the Schnorr protocol that uses Chris’s “magic boxes” to realize part of its functionality:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We did an additional test, and we’re ready to share further insights into the performance of disk imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-environment-and-measuring-methodology&#34;&gt;Test Environment and Measuring Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hardware setup for the new tests remained largely unchanged from the previous test. We used the same ASUS Vivobook S16 S5606MA laptop (Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 32GB RAM, Thunderbolt 4). However, this time, the storage device used was a powerful Samsung 860 PRO (512GB), which is miles ahead of the previously used test drive. Over 100GB of compressed data (a bunch of zip archives) was written to the drive for testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re building a custom PC, chances are you don&amp;rsquo;t want cable clutter crowding your chassis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When purchasing a new PC, you have two options: buy the parts and build your own custom PC, or get a prebuilt PC from a custom PC builder or an OEM. Either way, cable management is going to be an important factor in how good the finished custom PC looks and that can be a challenge. Things like ARGB fans introduce tons of additional cabling to the mix, as do USB hubs and other considerations. Even just handling the front panel connectors alone can be a challenge in some chassis, but with a few handy tips and some pre-planning, cable management can be tackled with a minimum of fuss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Single-board computers comprise a $3 billion market that’s only projected to grow for the next decade. That means there are a lot of options to choose from, but unless you have a very specific need in mind, there’s one name you should consider before any others: Raspberry Pi. Yes, there are dozens of SBC makers out there, but there are tons of reasons why Raspberry Pi still stands above them all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After using Windows my whole life, the Mac Mini turned me into an Apple fan. Can Microsoft ever turn things around?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until last November, Windows was all I ever used on my computers. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Windows user my entire life, and while I very briefly dabbled in Linux, I had no interest in staying there. When I chose to review the M4 Mac Mini, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d feel the same way about macOS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great saving on the 1TB model with heatsink, as it drops to $100&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the best SSDs that you can buy right now. Not only are you getting a proven track record and reliability that comes with the Samsung name, but this M.2 SSD offers excellent performance for a Gen 4 drive that sits above most in its class.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Valve will finally count to three.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the news? According to a renowned leaker, a new Half-Life project is currently undergoing friends and family testing over at Valve. People use the term &amp;ldquo;Half-Life 3&amp;rdquo; to refer to this game, but there&amp;rsquo;s no absolute 100% guarantee that it&amp;rsquo;s actually Half-Life 3. After all, we have the codename &amp;ldquo;HLX&amp;rdquo; but not a release title, so it might not be a third installment after all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How are you going to let a newcomer show you up on their second kick at the can?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years now, the king of the graphics card castle has been obvious. NVIDIA is and continues to be the gold standard for graphics cards, and AMD’s Radeon cards could just never quite stack up. The bad news doesn’t end there; Intel’s recent launch of their B580 GPU makes matters much worse. In only their second launch, Intel has done what AMD hasn’t been able to do for generations: create a graphics card that will fly off the shelves. The B580, despite its continued teething issues, is out of stock basically everywhere and shows exactly how AMD can’t keep pointing the finger elsewhere for its poor management of the Radeon division.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Valve broke new ground with the Steam Deck that launched PC handhelds into the stratosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Valve launched the Steam Machines in 2015, it was hardly to any kind of acclaim. It was an interesting idea: creating a Linux-based PC to provide a console-like gaming experience. SteamOS was in its infancy here, and while the Steam Machines flopped, Valve wasn’t done with trying to bring their own platform to market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your home server&amp;rsquo;s data isn&amp;rsquo;t backed up unless you have an offsite storage solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re running a home server, you probably already have your devices backing up their data to your storage pools. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the only place you should be storing backups, as the 3-2-1 backup rule means you should have one copy of your data at an offsite location. That could be a cloud storage service or a physical machine that&amp;rsquo;s further away than your garage, but for any truly important data, it&amp;rsquo;s a necessary cost to keep it safe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Threat actors might take advantage of previously unknown malware families - but a successful detection of certain methodologies or artifacts can help expose the entire infection chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In previous blog posts, we announced the integration of Sigma rules for macOS and Linux into VirusTotal, as well as ways in which Sigma rules can be converted to YARA to take advantage of VirusTotal Livehunt capabilities. In this post, we will show different approaches to hunt for interesting samples and derive new Sigma detection opportunities based on their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A must-have for the monitor aficionado.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find it hard to use a PC unless it has two monitors. It&amp;rsquo;s just nice to have something on the side while I&amp;rsquo;m working away on the main monitor. Some people have a need for five monitors, and I can&amp;rsquo;t even wrap my head around how I&amp;rsquo;d even begin to use that number of screens, but I respect (and fear) the people who do. If you&amp;rsquo;re one who enjoys multiple monitors, you&amp;rsquo;ll like this new Plugable dock announced at CES 2025 that can handle your love for a huge array of screens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of apps on the list, and you probably have at least some of them installed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We all know that apps collect our data, but what do companies do with that data? Some sell it, some use it for targeted advertising, some use it to help you connect with other users nearby, and there are countless other ways it can be used too. In a nightmare scenario, a firm that collects that data from thousands of apps has been hacked, with the hackers threatening to release all of the data publicly. This data includes customer lists, information about the industry, and historical location information collected from smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust Amazon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Overall Pick&amp;rdquo; options when it comes to new PC builds. Trust your own instincts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To many of us, PC building is second nature, but countless first-time PC builders get intimidated by the prospect of picking the right components for a new build. For someone used to shopping on Amazon for everything, relying on the site for PC component recommendations is often the obvious choice. For any search term, Amazon will throw up hundreds of results, with one of them labeled &amp;ldquo;Overall Pick.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But where it really shines is with its retro look and its versatility, with support for PC, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. While this controller usually has a retail price of $50, it can now be had for much less.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; expected for a while, but a direct confirmation of it along with a promise for more devices to come with it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily something most people had on their bingo cards for the show. What it means is that you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to install SteamOS on your PC or your gaming handheld, without a need to worry about dealing with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering if you should upgrade your graphics card, you should see these signs that it&amp;rsquo;s time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The graphics card on your PC does all the heavy lifting when you play your favorite games. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s one of the first components you should consider upgrading to improve your PC&amp;rsquo;s gaming performance. Unlike smartphones, though, most users don&amp;rsquo;t upgrade their PCs every two years or so. In fact, I try to hold on to my graphics card for as long as I can. But how do you know when it&amp;rsquo;s time to get a new one? Look out for these signs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2FA over SMS isn&amp;rsquo;t just unreliable, it&amp;rsquo;s also a security risk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MFA, or Multi-Factor Authentication, has proliferated throughout our computing lives over the last decade. It largely began with SMS-based authentication in addition to a password, allowing users to add an extra layer of authentication by forcing users to enter a code sent to their phone upon an attempted login. The truth is, SMS-based authentication was never secure. Due to the inherent technology and the infrastructure around SIM cards, 2FA with SMS is not only inadequate; it also actively compromises your security, and here are 4 reasons why you should use a dedicated 2FA app instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s quite common to use it for basic functionality like ending processes that refuse to close, but aside from that, there is a lot more it can do, too. If you want even more functionality, though, then you should try out an alternative like Task Manager DeLuxe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Will these add-ons make you switch to Sheets from Excel?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel is undoubtedly one of the most powerful apps out there to work with numbers. However, it requires an Office 365 subscription or an Office 2024 purchase, which isn&amp;rsquo;t feasible for a lot of users. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to shell out money, a good alternative to Excel is Google Sheets. Not only is it free to use, but it is also a simpler version for students with less intimidating features and options. Moreover, you also get a plethora of templates and features like extensions for added functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We discovered a Windows rootkit loader [F1] for the malware family FK_Undead. The malware family is known for intercepting user network traffic through manipulation of proxy configurations. To the best of our knowledge the rootkit loader hasn&amp;rsquo;t been officially analyzed before. As required by any Windows kernel driver, the rootkit loader is validly signed with the Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher certificate (see thumbprint [T1]). It is compatible with different Windows versions and protected with VMProtect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, we uncovered a sophisticated attack campaign employing a multi-stage approach to deliver AsyncRAT via a legitimate platform called Bitbucket.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/905978606/0/gdatasecurityblog-en&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gdatasoftware.com/fileadmin/_processed_/8/5/G_DATA_Blog_AsyncRAT_Preview_a169f602c5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Criminals try to cover their tracks as best they can. This also includes hiding any activities that control the machines they have compromised. Using I2P is one way of doing that, but until recently this has rarely been used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/909476600/0/gdatasecurityblog-en&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gdatasoftware.com/fileadmin/_processed_/7/a/G_DATA_Blog_I2P_RAT_Title_7eef9c9416.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ten infection and protection layers to deploy malware sounds impressive and very hard to deal with. However, adding more layers counterintuitively does the opposite for antivirus evasion and is not a sign of sophistication. Why is that so?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/902890910/0/gdatasecurityblog-en&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gdatasoftware.com/fileadmin/_processed_/8/9/G_DATA_Blog_Malware_Sophistication_Preview_0f9a0cebcb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you need to organize your projects, try using Kanban boards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Kanban board helps visualize all the tasks in your projects. It helps you see everything clearly, prioritize tasks, and track progress. Each task is represented by a card that moves along a path, usually labeled “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” This way, you can quickly see what’s happening, who’s doing what, and how the project is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sandbox scores are not an antivirus replacement</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/sandbox-scores-are-not-an-antivirus-replacement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automatic sandbox services should not be treated like &amp;ldquo;antivirus scanners&amp;rdquo; to determine maliciousness for samples. That’s not their intended use, and they perform poorly in that role. Unfortunately, providing an &amp;ldquo;overall score&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;verdict&amp;rdquo; is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/904821986/0/gdatasecurityblog-en&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.gdatasoftware.com/fileadmin/_processed_/7/b/G_DATA_Blog_Sandbox_Detections_Preview_6dd4ba1fc7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fbshare20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/fblike20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/x.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/email20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://assets.feedblitz.com/i/rss20.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t find a better price for this drive&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Portable SSDs are generally a great investment if you&amp;rsquo;re looking to store your data externally and need lightning-quick access. The only catch is that they usually don&amp;rsquo;t offer tons of storage space, limited to around 8TB if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at consumer-facing products. For most, that&amp;rsquo;s going to be enough, but if you need much more, and are looking to really back everything up, then this Seagate 20TB external HDD is going to be the perfect solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ventiva showed off the first laptop fully cooled by its ICE9 fanless tech at CES 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year, we were excited to see the launch of Ventiva&amp;rsquo;s wizard-like ICE9 fanless cooling technology and were wowed by their invention&amp;rsquo;s ability to push massive amounts of air without making a sound. We&amp;rsquo;ve been eagerly awaiting a real-world implementation of this product in a laptop, and thanks to the joint efforts of Ventiva, Dell, and Intel, the company debuted a laptop cooled entirely by their ICE technology at CES 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You might have seen Windows 11 labeling networks as public or private, but what do these options mean? It&amp;rsquo;s all about security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At one point or another, you may have noticed that Windows labels your Wi-Fi networks as either private or public networks in the Wi-Fi settings. In fact, by default, they&amp;rsquo;re all public networks, even if you&amp;rsquo;re using it at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Games business journalist Chris Dring offers insight into how Xbox Game Pass impacts game sales on Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Xbox unveiled its new generation of subscription services with Xbox Game Pass in 2017, the appeal for players was immediately apparent. Pay a monthly fee and get an ever-growing library of games right at your fingertips. Even brand-new releases from Xbox&amp;rsquo;s first-party studios, at no extra cost. Like Netflix, but for games, and with limited-time promotions that made the cost of a Game Pass subscription as low as $1, Game Pass colloquially earned the title, &amp;rsquo;the best deal in gaming.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acer&amp;rsquo;s new Predator laptops are headlined by the RTX 50 series GPUs and an amped up focus on performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few hours ago, Acer unveiled its new AI PCs, which fall under the Copilot+ Umbrella. Now, at CES 2025, the company is ready to take on the gaming market with its Predator refresh. As expected, the updated hardware is powered by AI, but perhaps more interesting to gamers would be the fact that it houses Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s RTX 50 series GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now, during CES 2025, Dell will open the gates once more and produce Alienware gaming devices that use the Area-51 name. But will it be a rise to past glories, or would Area-51 be better off locked up in Nevada?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the wait is over; we&amp;rsquo;re now seeing a ton of 5090 devices being announced to the public during this year&amp;rsquo;s big tech conference. MSI is by no means a slacker, as it has taken some time to break down all of its devices that it plans to release in the coming year, including a few that have the mighty 5090 powering their graphical heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A few months ago, the software giant also patched one of the famous setup exploits used to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A sneaky little tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Microsoft has been passing Google some seriously big compliments lately. A few months ago, Microsoft was copying Google&amp;rsquo;s homework by adopting a lot of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s features into Edge in hopes of getting people to change browsers. Now, if you use Bing to search for Google, it&amp;rsquo;ll do its best Google impression and hope you won&amp;rsquo;t notice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Laptop GPUs are, for the most part, not upgradeable. But there are some exceptions and workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the best laptops available today feature a dedicated (sometimes called discrete) graphics card (GPU) that can deliver much more performance than integrated processor (CPU) graphics. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a discrete GPU in the majority of high-end gaming laptops and laptops aimed at creators, such as the Surface Laptop Studio 2. These GPUs certainly add power to the laptop, but can you upgrade them in the future if you need more power?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even if you run into some challenges, it&amp;rsquo;s usually worth it for the feeling of turning it on for the first time knowing you have a faster (presumably) better experience waiting for you. Then there&amp;rsquo;s that moment when you realize you still have to install an operating system, such as Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flow Launcher and PowerToys Run can both make the Start menu obsolete on Windows 11. But which one is actually better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most people, opening apps with the Start menu and desktop icons works totally fine. But if you&amp;rsquo;re someone who spends a lot of time on the computer and you want to do things as efficiently as possible, a custom launcher becomes almost a necessity as it speeds things up a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let dust and other particles beat you and your mighty system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dust is your PC&amp;rsquo;s worst nightmare. It infiltrates the chassis, lands on a component, and starts to accumulate over time. Too much dust can create a layer of insulation, causing the hardware to run hotter than usual. Clogging up fans could result in less air being forced through vents and the performance of everything inside your PC will be compromised. Luckily, keeping dust outside your PC, or at least keeping on top of the stuff that makes it inside your system, is easier than you may think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The electricity grid – the buzzing, crackling marvel that supplies the lifeblood of modernity - is by far the largest structure humanity ever built. It’s so big, in fact, that few people even notice it, like a fish can’t see the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until the grid goes down, that is. Then, like the fish dangling from the angler’s hook, we see our vulnerability. Modernity dissolves into a sudden silence, followed by the repeated flick of a light switch, and a howl of panic at the prospect of missed appointmen&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Create your own custom router with an old PC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OPNsense will run on just about anything, including a low-power Raspberry Pi single-board computer (SBC). I have an old Minisforum NucBox 2 collecting dust and decided to throw OPNsense on the system to act as a testbench of sorts for loading up plugins, configuring various parts of the firewall OS, and testing deployments before applying changes to my primary OPNsense device, which was a purchase specifically for running as a router.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to use BitLocker to encrypt your external drives&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Windows 11, Windows 10, and even older versions come pre-installed with a security and encryption feature called BitLocker. It enables users to encrypt everything on the drive where Windows is installed, protecting that data from theft or unauthorized access. If you haven’t heard of it, that’s because the feature isn’t available on every Windows PC. It is only available on the Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SMS services remain a critical part of telecommunications; they don&amp;rsquo;t require Internet access, and companies use them to inform their customers. This combination of features makes them incredibly useful for criminals who use the technology as a stepping stone in their never-ending campaigns. And if you think that the new RCS messaging standard will offer any protection, you would be wrong. These types of scams will continue to spread regardless of the messaging standard used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not only do you have to ensure that every plug socket has a cable attached to it, but you also (or rather, should) ensure that everything is kept neat. Well, if one prototype proves successful, you may not need to attach a power cable to your GPU anymore, as people are working on powering it entirely through the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bitdefender researchers investigated a series of incidents at high-level organizations in countries of the South China Sea region, all performed by the same  threat actor we track as Unfading Sea Haze. Based on the victimology and the cyber-attack’s aim, we believe the threat actor is aligned with China’s interests. As tensions in the region rise, they are reflected in the intensification of activity on behalf of the Unfading Sea Haze actor, which uses new and improved tools and TTPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It requires minimal additional materials, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi cases are a great way to ensure your SBC isn&amp;rsquo;t sitting around, exposed to the elements. However, just because they&amp;rsquo;re practical doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they have to be boring. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen plenty of 3D-printed Raspberry Pi cases in the past, but this one is especially notable as an excellent addition for anyone using their SBC as a retro console.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to Source&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Get the thock you always wanted with these simple mods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love my mechanical keyboard. For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a Keychron K2 V2 with minor upgrades every now and then. Trust me when I say this &amp;ndash; once you switch to a mechanical keyboard &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s no going back. There are a plethora of mechanical keyboards out there in the market that you can buy, or you could even build your own mechanical keyboard with custom parts. Regardless of which option you choose, the world of mechanical keyboards is a rabbit hole that keeps going deeper and deeper. What I mean to say is, that you can keep upgrading or modding your keyboard with time to make it even better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Only a year ago, we saw the release of Scala 3.4.0-RC1, and now we’re trying out Scala 3.6.2 with many new experimental features. The last 12 months have brought many new features to the IntelliJ Scala Plugin as well. A year ago we introduced X-Ray mode, which lets you easily augment the code you see in the editor with information about inferred types and other details. We’ve improved Scala 3 support, compiler-based highlighting, and the debugger. We’ve improved auto-completion, both the standard and the AI-powered versions. We’ve introduced support for named tuples, which are still an experimental feature, and we’ve implemented a new way to work with sbt projects. On top of all that, this year, JetBrains joined the Scala Advisory Board. You can read about those changes in our release notes and other blog posts:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feature flags offer an excellent way to quickly turn off and on product changes by enabling you to remove and add the code in the software quickly. Marketers or product managers can choose a time and moment to make a feature or function live to win that aha moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The feature flags are helpful to various departments, including marketing, product, testing, CROs, and development. The number of feature flags can rise quickly as the team realizes their helpfulness and begins to utilize them. To avoid the mismanagement it may create, you need feature flag platforms. A comprehensive space where you can place all your feature flags and manage, modify, and delete them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most teams start with basic security practices, such as branch protection and simple access controls. But, there&amp;rsquo;s often a moment when teams realize they need more. It could be when they land their first enterprise client, when they start handling sensitive data, or when they experience their first security incident.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure whether you’re ready to upgrade your security, here are a few signs you’ve outgrown your security needs:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As development teams grow, what once worked for a small team often becomes a bottleneck. Code standards become inconsistent, operational silos develop, and technical debt accumulates faster. What was a well-oiled machine is now dysfunctional as more team members, projects, and tools are added on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many teams experience these challenges as they grow, but how you handle and address these growing pains can save you time, energy, and money in the long run. In this article, we’ll explore the common pitfalls growing teams face and how successful organizations address them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first part of our three-part series on test generation with GitLab Duo focused on how to automate code testing. Now, we will share the lessons we learned while using AI for test generation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;situations-we-encountered-and-how-we-handled-them&#34;&gt;Situations we encountered and how we handled them&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, we were pleased with the results using GitLab Duo to generate tests on our code. As is the case with any language generation, some cases required minor adjustments such as fixing import paths or editing contents in datasets. For the more complex cases, we had to remember that AI solutions often lack context. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we handled the more complex testing situations with GitLab Duo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accelerated by the pandemic, online tech communities have grown rapidly. With new members joining every day, it’s tough to keep track of past conversations. Often, newcomers ask questions that have already been answered, causing repetition and redundancy. To tackle this, we built an intelligent assistant that tracks past conversations, searches Stack Overflow for technical help, and browses the web for relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;InSightful is a ReAct (Reasoning and Action) Agent with access to multiple tools, such as a web searcher and a context retriever, to achieve the given task. In our case, it is a question and answer application. We will delve deeper into the workings of the application as we progress. At the end of the day, you will be able to understand how agents work and how you can develop your own. These agents are highly customizable, giving you a lot of flexibility in picking a use-case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Internal Load Balancer (ILB) is now generally available (GA) for all DigitalOcean customers. Earlier this year, on October 17, we announced early access (EA) to Internal Load Balancer, one of our latest Networking feature releases. October 17 was a while ago, so here is a refresher on Internal Load Balancer (ILB):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-digitalocean-internal-load-balancer&#34;&gt;What is DigitalOcean Internal Load Balancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean Internal Load Balancer (ILB) is a regional load balancing solution designed to help facilitate more secure and efficient routing of internal traffic for private workloads. Unlike public-facing load balancers, the ILB operates within a private network, using private IP addresses to distribute HTTP, TCP, or UDP traffic across resources like Droplets and Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters. This helps to ensure that traffic remains isolated from the public internet, enhancing security and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/guide-to-gpu-sharing-techniques-vgpu-mig-and-time-slicing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Optimizing GPU utilization is essential in modern computing, particularly for AI and ML processing, where GPUs play a pivotal role due to their unparalleled ability to handle parallel computations and process large datasets rapidly. Modern GPUs are invaluable in these fields. They have thousands of cores that enable very high parallelism. This enables complex model training and real-time data analysis that are impractical with traditional CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By fully utilizing GPU resources, organizations can accelerate MLOps workflows, achieve faster insights, and enhance the efficiency of their computing infrastructure. This leads to significant cost savings by reducing the need for additional hardware and operational expenses, while also improving scalability and flexibility to meet the dynamic demands of contemporary computational tasks. One key method for optimizing GPU utilization is by sharing the GPUs among different workloads. This is where virtual GPU (vGPU), Multi-Instance GPUs (MIG) and GPU Time-Slicing come to our rescue!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/improving-rag-accuracy-with-rerankers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our previous post, we talked about creating an AI agent for technical communities that can use the conversation history amongst colleagues and other members to answer the user’s common questions. InSightful is the agent we built that uses the Reasoning and Action (ReAct) approach to respond to user queries accurately. However, during the retrieval process the generalization of the retrieved information causes the agent to provide a high-level overview of the information. You can greatly improve the results of the retrieved information from the conversation history within a community by retrieving relevant &lt;strong&gt;specific&lt;/strong&gt; information according to a query. This can be achieved with a reranker.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming industries, from automotive to finance. Since the advent of using GPUs for AI/ML workloads in the last few years, processing large amounts of data has become significantly faster. Workload orchestrators like Kubernetes have also played an important role in maximizing GPU compute power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, one of the critical bottlenecks in this process is often the networking infrastructure. AI/ML training and inference workloads require the rapid and reliable transfer of massive datasets. Even the most powerful GPUs can be underutilized without an optimized networking setup, leading to significant delays and inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developer platforms reduce developers’ cognitive load by abstracting away the various complexities of infrastructure and the development process, eventually improving their productivity and workflow. However, building a developer platform can be complex, and organizations could fail at it the first time. The primary reason is the lack of proper communication between the team building the platform and the team that will use it. Another reason for failing at platform engineering is not having clarity on what is important and what should be added to the platform. What are the elements necessary to build a helpful developer platform? And no, platform engineering is not only about tools or IDPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean has been providing a managed Kubernetes service since 2019. Over those years, our infrastructure has changed a huge amount, notably in the form of a new and improved Containerised Control Plane (CCP) architecture launched in 2021. In this post, we’ll explore the journey we took to the new architecture using an open source project called Cluster API. This was combined with some DigitalOcean ‘’’scrappy magic’’’ to provide a scalable, fault tolerant, managed Kubernetes service for customers. We’ve written about it in the past, but it’s time to dive in and swim through the details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Modernizing a simple C&#43;&#43; application to Java with GitLab Duo&lt;/div&gt;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Memory unsafe languages are those that do not handle any memory management on behalf of the developer. For example, when programming in C or C++, if you need memory during runtime, you will need to allocate and deallocate the memory yourself, running the risk of ending up with memory leaks in cases when you inadvertently forget to deallocate it. Other languages like Ada and FORTRAN provide some memory management but may not prevent memory leaks. Many organizations, including those in the public sector, have applications that have been developed using languages that are memory unsafe and are often looking to modernize these to a memory safe language, such as Java, Python, JavaScript, or Golang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&lt;div&gt;Primer on Distributed Parallel Processing with Ray using KubeRay&lt;/div&gt;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the early days of computing, applications handled tasks sequentially. As the scale grew with millions of users, this approach became impractical. Asynchronous processing allowed handling multiple tasks concurrently, but managing threads/processes on a single machine led to resource constraints and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is where distributed parallel processing comes in. By spreading the workload across multiple machines, each dedicated to a portion of the task, it offers a scalable and efficient solution. If you have a function to process a large batch of files, you can divide the workload across multiple machines to process files concurrently instead of handling them sequentially on one machine. Additionally, it improves performance by leveraging combined resources and provides scalability and fault tolerance. As the demands increase, you can add more machines to increase available resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post (originally published in 2019) has been updated to include recent product updates and cost calculations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many companies are moving to Kubernetes as the platform of choice for running software workloads. When an organization using VMs in AWS earlier decides to move to Kubernetes (Either EKS or self-managed in AWS), one of the questions that come up is whether one should continue to use Amazon CloudWatch or switch to some other tool like Prometheus? Many organizations think managing Prometheus can be challenging and bring more overheads. Recently, AWS launched a managed Prometheus service for such organizations. While CloudWatch vs Prometheus is not an exact apple to apple comparison, there are reasons to explore this and choose tooling that is built for the future. This post will explore various aspects and pros and cons, including costs of all three options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the training phase, a machine learning (ML) model recognizes patterns in the training data and stores these patterns as numerical values called weights (model parameters). These parameters are used to predict an answer when the model is given new input data or a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, when you ask a question to ChatGPT or any other Large Language Model (LLM), it generates the answer for you. Other ML models are used to detect fraud transactions, image or even audio classification, and so on. These are examples of inference, where the ML model generates or predicts the answer based on the training data. For the inference to run, we need inference servers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While everyone is talking about new models and their possible use cases, their deployment aspect often gets overlooked. The journey from a trained model to a production-ready service is a complex and nuanced process that deserves more attention. From the perspective of a web API server, when a developer needs to access information like user profiles or services, we typically create a REST API service that interacts with the database. This API service also handles business logic, enabling the system to process and serve thousands of requests per minute efficiently. However, it is different when we talk about serving models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s 9 a.m. somewhere, and a DevOps engineer is starting their day. They check their GitLab todo list to see any mentions or tasks assigned to them, collaborating with other stakeholders in their organization. These tasks can include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;managing infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;maintaining the configuration of resources&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;maintaining CI/CD pipelines&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;automating processes for efficiency&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;maintaining monitoring and alerting systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ensuring applications are securely built and deployed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;modernizing applications with containerization&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To carry out these tasks, DevOps engineers spend a lot of time reading documentation, writing configuration files, and searching for help in forums, issues boards, and blogs. Time is spent studying and understanding concepts, and how tools and technologies work. When they don&amp;rsquo;t work as expected, a lot more time is spent investigating why. New tools are released regularly to solve niche or existing problems differently, which introduces more things to learn and maintain context for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crowdstrike reported a 75% increase in cloud environment intrusions from 2022 to 2023 (source). IBM’s cost of data breach report shows that the global average cost of a data breach in 2024 is USD 4.88M, a 10% increase over last year and the highest total ever. Cyber attacks would scale much faster with the help of artificial intelligence. If organizations are not prepared, the consequences will be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many security frameworks that can help organizations enable security and safety for their applications and users. In this blog post, we will discuss NIST CSF, one of the most used security frameworks that helps organizations understand and prevent cybersecurity risks. We will cover the key enhancements in NIST CSF 2.0 briefly, explain the primary components of CSF in detail, and show the best practices for maintaining NIST CSF in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While manual code review processes may suffice for a small team, as DevSecOps teams scale, the processes create significant bottlenecks that impede software development velocity and quality. Often slow, inconsistent, and frequently failing to catch critical vulnerabilities, the manual approach leads to technical debt and increased security risks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To mitigate risks and drive innovation, organizations must prioritize automated code quality and compliance systems. The financial implications of poor code management are substantial, with technical debt consuming up to 40% of IT budgets (McKinsey Digital: Tech Debt Report) and software vulnerabilities costing an average of $4.88 million per security breach (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enterprises are increasingly turning to Kubernetes for container orchestration, drawn by its promise of scalability, agility, and portability. While cloud-based Kubernetes solutions have gained traction, on-premises deployments remain a compelling option for organizations seeking greater control, security, and cost-efficiency. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on bare metal using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE2). Plus, we will configure MetalLB as a load balancer and integrate Rook-Ceph as a storage orchestrator for persistent storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you speak to teams or organizations running Kubernetes in production, one of the complaints you’ll often hear is how difficult multi-tenancy is. Organizations follow two approaches to share Kubernetes clusters with multiple tenants (multiple teams or people).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those two approaches are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Namespace-based multi-tenancy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cluster-based multi-tenancy&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Namespace-based multi-tenancy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In namespace-based multi-tenancy, each team or tenant is restricted to a single namespace or a specific set of namespaces. The administrator is responsible for restricting access through RBAC. Once the team/tenant gains permissions they will be deploying their applications (pods) to these sets of namespaces. Though it appears simple and flawless, here are some of the drawbacks of this approach:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DigitalOcean Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private networking solution that provides isolation for resources running on the DigitalOcean public cloud on isolated private networks. As of this writing, Droplets, DigitalOcean’s virtual machines, and Managed Databases products can run natively on VPC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-digitalocean-vpc&#34;&gt;What is DigitalOcean VPC?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over time there has been a growing need for secure networks, driven by the increase in digital footprints of online businesses, and greater needs for cloud mobility and ever increasing data breaches over networks. VPC provides a more secure, isolated, private IP network within the DigitalOcean cloud. Private networking of this form provides a strong security foundation with increased protection and privacy of data as it moves around within the DigitalOcean ecosystem isolated from the public internet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used AI tools like ChatGPT to chat with a robot or Stable Diffusion to generate unique images? Wondered how they work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Familiar apps, like the contacts app you use, use structured data, i.e., name, phone number, email address, and a few more text and numeric fields. While AI apps deal with different kinds of data that are unstructured. Some examples of unstructured data are articles, chats, pictures, multimedia, etc. These are quite complex for computer programs to process and understand the context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we’ve witnessed two recurring trends: the release of increasingly powerful GPUs and the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions or trillions of parameters and expansive context windows. Many businesses are leveraging these LLMs by fine-tuning them or building out apps with domain-specific knowledge using RAG and deploying them on dedicated GPU servers. Now, when it comes to deploying these models on GPU, one thing to notice is the model size, i.e., the space required (for storing the parameters and context tokens) to load the model into the GPU memory is too high compared to the memory available on the GPU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In an organisation with many repositories and developers that are frequently shifting the maintenance of OWNERS and OWNERS_ALIASES files can be tedious. In the passing year a couple of functionalities has been added to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreign-aliases&#34;&gt;Foreign aliases&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To avoid maintaining the OWNERS_ALIASES file in many repositories you can now refer to the OWNERS_ALIASES file in another repository. In the Jenkins X project we have the main OWNERS_ALIASES file in the jx-community repository. So in the jx repository the OWNERS_ALIASES file only looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, I am Rajat Gupta, pursuing my bachelor’s in Information Technology. In 2022, I have been selected as a student developer in Google Summer of Code under Jenkins X. We will be building a new UI for Jenkins X. I got this news on May 20th, as I received an email from google.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-started&#34;&gt;How I started&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The technologies needed were &lt;strong&gt;Golang&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;GitOps&lt;/strong&gt;. I used golang only once before, while linting Jenkins X codebase, I only used Kubernetes once before while setting up a k3s cluster to run Jenkins X pipelines. These tasks were necessary to do for all GSoC participants. Apart from that, I was a total beginner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/blog-gsoc-2022-final-report-building-jenkins-x-ui/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;jenkins-x-new-ui&#34;&gt;Jenkins X New UI&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a web application built with Golang for the backend and Sveltekit for the frontend, both of which are built together and used in the same container. To function properly, it must be installed as a helm chart with Jenkins X CRDs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;🌟 It has light and dark themes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/gsoc-work-report-22/homepage.png&#34; alt=&#34;homepage.png&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/gsoc-work-report-22/pipelinesPage.png&#34; alt=&#34;pipelinesPage.png&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-need-a-new-ui&#34;&gt;Why need a new UI?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good UI is essential for a CI/CD tool, as not everyone is familiar with the CLI. The current UI (jx-pipeline-visualizer) is a read-only UI, the user can view the logs of PipelineActivity but neither can start nor stop the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Supply chain security is a rising concern in the current software era. Securing the software supply chain encompasses vulnerability remediation and the implementation of controls throughout the software development process. Due to massive increase in attacks on software supply chain and the diversity of its types, Jenkins X has to make efforts to ensure that the build process is secure. As part of securing Jenkins X installation by default I worked on both securing our own components and enabling our users to use these features in their build and release steps..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A standard part of the Jenkins X pipelines since a long time is the execution of &lt;code&gt;jx changelog create&lt;/code&gt; that takes the commit messages between the release currently being created and the previous one and creates a change log from these. The change log is then stored as a release note in GitHub or other git provider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the last year some improvements have landed in various Jenkins X components to improve the changelogs and their usefulness. So I’ll take this opportunity to describe these improvements and also in general give hints to how to get useful changelogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before going through Software Bill Of Materials (SBOMs), we need to set the ground for a rising concern in the software industry which is Software Supply Chain Security. Like traditional industries, deploying a piece of a software artifact goes through multiple stages composed of collecting source code components, libraries, tools, and processes used in those stages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://jenkins-x.io/images/sbom-guide/supply-chain.png&#34; alt=&#34;comparing the different steps in a real world supply chain with software supply chain&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To allow Jenkins X to support Kubernetes 1.22, we had to update our version of Tekton. This updated version of Tekton contains breaking changes that has consequences if you made your own custom Jenkins X pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make sure that your custom pipelines continue to work after this upgrade, you must edit the resource settings in your pipelines. Otherwise your pipelines will most likely not be able to start at all, or if they do, consume a lot of resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google has announced that container registry will be shut down some time after March 18, 2025. For GKE clusters created with version 1.12.0 or later of terraform-google-jx it’s unlikely that anything needs to be done, but for older clusters you should upgrade your cluster while considering our advice regarding migration from container registry to artifact registry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are using a Google Service Account to run terraform you need to add the role requirement roles/artifactregistry.admin. See our guide regarding Google Service Account for details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

CD events integration with Jenkins X&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h5 id=&#34;description&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cdEvents project standardises the way systems talk to each other, which enables Interoperability between systems so they speak a common language through the cdEvents spec in the event. Creating a capability in Jenkins X that can receive and sent a cdEvent would benefit the project and the DevOps ecosystem in general, by stopping glue code used to integrate systems and power innovation by letting end users swap out tools with no effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blog: Reconcile with kpt live apply</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/blog-reconcile-with-kpt-live-apply/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/blog-reconcile-with-kpt-live-apply/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of Jenkins X 3 the default last step of reconciling the state of the files in your cluster repository to your cluster has been to execute &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt;. You can find more details about this here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some drawbacks with &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt; though. The one that made me start looking for alternatives was that if you remove a resource from your cluster repository it may not be removed from your cluster. The way deletion works with &lt;code&gt;kubectl apply&lt;/code&gt; is that it is handed the option &lt;code&gt;--prune&lt;/code&gt; which will remove resources that are not in the manifests. Except that it doesn’t always work as expected. It will only remove certain kinds of resources defined in kubectl. In my case I removed an HorizontalPodAutoscaler from my cluster repository, but it wasn’t removed from my cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisite&#34;&gt;Prerequisite&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t understand what is Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), please read this blog post first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-sbom-formats-comparison&#34;&gt;Different SBOM formats comparison&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in the U.S. defined minimum requirements for SBOM formats:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identifying the supplier of the software component.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Identifying the details about the version of the component.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Including unique identifiers for the component like cryptographic hash functions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Including the relationships between all dependencies inside the component.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Including a timestamp of when and by whom the SBOM report was created or last modified&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this section, we discuss different kinds and formats for SBOM standards and make a brief comparison between them. Three commonly used standards achieved the NTIA minimum requirements for SBOM generation and each one results in a different final SBOM document.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisite&#34;&gt;Prerequisite&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before you read this, you have to understand what are SBOMs and what are different formats of SBOMs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;different-sbom-generation-tools-comparison&#34;&gt;Different SBOM generation tools comparison&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you got this far, you already realize the importance of SBOM generation, and also it should meet certain requirements to achieve its purpose. Due to various requirements depending on what standard you’re following, there has to be a way to automatically generate different output formats for different standards. Also, it has to be suited for ci/cd solutions to keep up with the increasing number of releases for each organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloud RAN with Google Distributed Cloud Edge; Strategy: host network functions of other vendors on Google Cloud</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At MWC 2023 Barcelona, &lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; announced that they can now run the &lt;strong&gt;radio access network (RAN)&lt;/strong&gt; functions as software on Google Distributed Cloud Edge, providing communications service providers (CSPs- AKA telcos) with a common and agile operating model that extends from the core of the network to the edge, for a high degree of programmability, flexibility, and low operating expenses.  CSPs have already embraced open architecture, open-source software, disaggregation, automation, cloud, AI and machine learning, and new operational models, to name a few. The journey started in the last decade with Network Functions Virtualization, primarily with value added services and then deeper with core network applications, and in the past few years, that evolved into a push towards cloud-native. With significant progress in the core, the time for &lt;strong&gt;Cloud RAN&lt;/strong&gt; is now, according to Google.  However, whether for industry or region-specific compliance reasons, data sovereignty needs, or latency or local data-processing requirements, most of the network functions deployed in a mobile or wireline network may have to follow a hybrid deployment model where network functions are placed flexibly in a combination of both on-premises and cloud regions. RAN, which is traditionally implemented with proprietary hardware, falls into that camp as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how GitHub Artifact Attestations can enhance your build security and help your organization achieve SLSA Level 3. This post breaks down the basics of SLSA, explains the importance of artifact attestations, and provides a step-by-step guide to securing your build process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post Enhance build security and reach SLSA Level 3 with GitHub Artifact Attestations appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The need for software build security is more pressing than ever. High-profile software supply chain attacks like SolarWinds, MOVEit, 3CX, and Applied Materials have revealed just how vulnerable the software build process can be. As attackers exploit weaknesses in the build pipeline to inject their malicious components, traditional security measures—like scanning source code, securing production environments and source control allow lists—are no longer enough. To defend against these sophisticated threats, organizations must treat their build systems with the same level of care and security as their production environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Survey data and discussions with enterprise networking professionals reveal they are still grappling with many networking issues spawned by the expansion of the cloud – the most common of which include &lt;strong&gt;securing connections&lt;/strong&gt; for remote work, implementing zero-trust security strategies, and integrating myriad cloud and wide-area networks (WANs).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in &lt;strong&gt;Futuriom’s&lt;/strong&gt; latest survey of 196 enterprise IT and networking professionals, more than 80% said the complexity of connecting the wide variety of networks was a large challenge. At nearly 70% of responses, expertise and knowledge was the second-largest challenge (multiple responses were allowed), and cost was cited by 60%.  Please refer to survey highlights below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By embedding security into every phase of the development lifecycle, organizations can deploy faster and collaborate more efficiently while ensuring security at every step. Yet, despite its advantages, according to IDC’s 2024 DevSecOps and Software Supply Chain Security Survey, only 66% of application development teams use DevSecOps methodologies on average. If it were easy to implement, that number would be much closer to 100%. So, what’s holding teams back? Let’s explore the most common challenges—and how to address them. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November, we experienced one incident that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post GitHub Availability Report: November 2024 appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In November, we experienced one incident that resulted in degraded performance across GitHub services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 19 10:56 UTC (lasting 1 hour and 7 minutes)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On November 19, 2024, between 10:56:00 UTC and 12:03:00 UTC, the notifications service was degraded and stopped sending notifications to all our dotcom customers. On average, notification delivery was delayed by about one hour. This was due to a database host coming out of a regular maintenance process in read-only mode.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Guia para certificação Vue Mid-Level</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/guia-para-certificacao-vue-mid-level/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspirado neste post, resolvi também escrever um texto do caminho que fiz para conseguir a certificação em Vue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trabalho com Vue há 3 anos, e no momento estamos fazendo a transição da aplicação de Vue2 para Vue3, então estudar para a certificação me pareceu um bom caminho para atualizar os conhecimentos no framework.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Se você está começando no mundo do desenvolvimento web, não recomendo que faça a certificação, pois a mesma está custando atualmente quase R$600,00 e e acredito que você consegue extrair mais valor fazendo cursos e outras atividades com este dinheiro. Mas se você já é um profissional experiente e quer colocar seus conhecimentos a prova, exibir o badge de dev Vue e ajudar o desenvolvimento do framework (parte do dinheiro vai para a equipe do Vue), recomendo que o faça.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Laravel and want an easier, more streamlined way to define routes without manually writing them in &lt;code&gt;web.php&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;Laravel Folio&lt;/strong&gt; is something you should definitely check out!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-laravel-folio&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Laravel Folio?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Laravel Folio is a powerful page based router designed to simplify routing in Laravel applications.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;With Laravel Folio, generating a route becomes as effortless as creating a Blade template within your application&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;resources/views/pages&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Laravel Folio lets you define routes based on file structure. For example, if you have a file named &lt;code&gt;about.blade.php&lt;/code&gt; in your views folder, it will automatically create a route &lt;code&gt;/about&lt;/code&gt;—no need to touch the traditional routes file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/memory-management-in-java-java-virtual-machine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is an overview of memory management in Java. It explains key components of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), including the stack, heap, and garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Memory management in Java is essential for various reasons. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) automates memory handling by utilizing stack, heap, and garbage collection system. This lightens the load on developers by taking care of memory allocation and deallocation. Nonetheless, developers can not overlook memory management entirely. See the definitions for JVM, stack, heap, and garbage collection at the end of the post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-Path TCP: revolutionizing connectivity, one path at a time</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/multi-path-tcp-revolutionizing-connectivity-one-path-at-a-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/multi-path-tcp-revolutionizing-connectivity-one-path-at-a-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet is designed to provide multiple paths between two endpoints. Attempts to exploit multi-path opportunities are almost as old as the Internet, culminating in RFCs documenting some of the challenges. Still, today, virtually all end-to-end communication uses only one available path at a time. Why? It turns out that in multi-path setups, even the smallest differences between paths can harm the connection quality due to packet reordering and other issues. As a result, Internet devices usually use a single path and let the routers handle the path selection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/my-take-on-the-memory-layer-paper-by-meta-noob-friendly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ref : &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764&#34;&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09764&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So Meta FAIR&amp;rsquo;s new paper is a banger as always coming from them lol. This one is about increasing model capabilities but with fewer FLOPs spent for the same or more number of parameters basically. What they changed is where the FLOPs (computation in GPU terms , we AI folks like to call it that way).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in traditional architecture, you got the input converted to a vector representation and the attention heads transforms them to imbue them with context within the input and then this transformed input is passed to the MLP, this is the actual Neural net that has in its parameters the reasoning and memory both encoded. As the input vector passes through each layer, the input is transformed with a bit of reasoning and knowledge that the model learnt during the course of its learning. Then we do this for a bunch of times and in the end the vector represents the next token that should be part of the input. Pretty standard. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telco cloud&lt;/strong&gt; has evolved from the much hyped (but commercially failed) &lt;strong&gt;NFV/Virtual Network Functions or VNFs&lt;/strong&gt; and classical &lt;strong&gt;SDN architectures,&lt;/strong&gt; to today’s more robust platforms for &lt;strong&gt;managing virtualized and cloud-native network functions&lt;/strong&gt; that are tailored to the needs of telecom network workloads. This shift is bringing many new participants to the rapidly evolving &lt;strong&gt;telco cloud&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;strong&gt;1.]&lt;/strong&gt; landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note 1.&lt;/strong&gt;  In this instance, “&lt;strong&gt;telco cloud&lt;/strong&gt;” means running telco network functions, including &lt;strong&gt;5G SA Core network&lt;/strong&gt; on a public, private, or hybrid cloud platform. It does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; imply that telcos are going to be cloud service providers (CSPs) and compete with Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM, Alibaba and other established CSPs.  Telcos gave up on that years ago and sold most of their own data centers which they intended to make cloud resident.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simplified Data Masking in AWS Lambda with Powertool</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Devs,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Data is the new oil,” they say, but in healthcare and finance, it’s more like nitroglycerin—immensely valuable, yet dangerously explosive if mishandled.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently shared on social media that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined the healthcare industry. This marks a shift from my background in both e-commerce and finance. During my time in finance, I dealt extensively with highly sensitive data like bank statements, KYC information, personal identification details, and other financial records. I vividly recall understanding that even a minor data handling error could have severe repercussions: breaches, fines, and, most importantly, a loss of public trust. This same level of data sensitivity exists in healthcare, where every piece of patient information is crucial and protected by regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. To comply with these regulations and similar ones worldwide, data masking has become essential. In this blog, I’ll break down what Powertools is, how it can be used for data masking in AWS Lambda, and why it’s critical for domains like finance and healthcare. While Powertools for AWS Lambda existed for .NET and TypeScript, the May 2024 release of Python support has been a major boost, making it accessible to a much wider audience. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into Powertools for AWS Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We released a new open source byte-pair tokenizer that is faster and more flexible than popular alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The post So many tokens, so little time: Introducing a faster, more flexible byte-pair tokenizer appeared first on The GitHub Blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs), such as those used by GitHub Copilot, do not operate directly on bytes but on &lt;em&gt;tokens&lt;/em&gt;, which can complicate scaling. In this post, we explain how we solved that challenge at GitHub to support the growing number of Copilot users and features since the first launching Copilot two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The move to AI and cloud native is accelerating amongst network equipment and IT vendors which have announced highly integrated smart cloud solutions designed to migrate their &lt;strong&gt;telco customers&lt;/strong&gt; into a new and profitable cloud future.  The &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF),&lt;/strong&gt; as the name suggests, is a vendor-neutral consortium dedicated to making &lt;strong&gt;cloud native&lt;/strong&gt; ubiquitous. The group defines cloud native as a collection of “technologies [that] empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The adoption of cloud-native methodologies, processes and tools has been a challenge for communications service providers (CSPs), aka telcos or network operators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telcos are embracing cloud-native processes and tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s part of their evolution towards being digital service providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the cloud-native journey is still in its early stages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real cultural change is needed if telcos are to capitalise fully on the cloud-native opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alongside a a session, Why cloud native is essential to delivering the automation, agility and innovation needed to support new services, at Telco TV’s DSP Leaders World Forum event in Windsor, UK, a poll was taken.  The following question was asked, &lt;strong&gt;“How can Digital Service Providers maximize the cloud-native opportunities?”&lt;/strong&gt;  Respondents were able to select all the options they deemed relevant.  Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

During a recent threat-hunting operation, they uncovered a surprising new attack vector: threat actors using misconfigured servers to hijack environments for streaming sports events. By exploiting misconfigured JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook applications, attackers drop live streaming capture tools and duplicate the broadcast on their illegal server, thus conducting stream ripping. In this blog, we explain how our threat hunting operation helped us uncover this and how we analyzed this attack using Aqua Tracee and Traceeshark.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this campaign, TeamTNT appears to be returning to its roots while preparing for a large-scale attack on cloud native environments. The group is currently targeting exposed Docker daemons to deploy Sliver malware, a cyber worm, and cryptominers, using compromised servers and Docker Hub as the infrastructure to spread their malware.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

There’s now a similar pie menu launcher for most Linux desktops as well as Windows and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s Kando, a free open-source application written mostly in TypeScript programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With it, user can trigger a circular application launcher on desktop, then either use mouse clicks or draw gesture to launch apps, run custom scripts/commands, simulate shortcut key, or open files/websites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ubuntuhandbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/kando-piemenu.mp4&#34;&gt;https://ubuntuhandbook.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/kando-piemenu.mp4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kando is designed to be used with mouse, stylus, touch, or controller input. It works in Windows, macOS, and Linux with most desktop environments, such as GNOME, KDE, MATE, XFCE, and Cinnamon, though some (e.g., Cosmic and Niri) are so far not implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Qt5 is still supported, but will be removed in the next 2.6 release series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Probably due to this change, Ubuntu 20.04 is no longer officially supported, though user can choose to use the Flatpak package run in sandbox environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since its inception in 2014, Giant Swarm has been 100% remote — not as an afterthought or a late-minute addendum but as part of its core (and I think very cool) founding philosophy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An ever-evolving philosophy that challenges the status quo and invites us to do things better and differently, all while not taking itself too seriously. As our VP People Anna noted, &lt;em&gt;“Being remote is just a form of organization. You need human structures and psychological safety regardless.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using solutions from the world’s leading open source and hybrid cloud provider on the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular cloud provider is simpler than you think.A new strategic collaboration agreement with AWS will significantly expand availability of Red Hat offerings in AWS Marketplace, accelerating cloud modernization through virtualization and AI.IT leaders face the dual challenge of pushing innovation while managing cost and complexity.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containerized application development has revolutionized modern software delivery, but slow image builds in CI/CD pipelines can bring developer productivity to a halt. Even with AWS CodeBuild automating application testing and building, teams face challenges like resource constraints, inefficient caching, and complex multi-architecture builds that lead to delays, lower release frequency, and prolonged recovery times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enter Docker Build Cloud, a high-performance cloud service designed to streamline image builds, integrate seamlessly with AWS CodeBuild, and reduce build times dramatically. With Docker Build Cloud, you gain powerful cloud-based builders, shared caching, and native multi-architecture support — all while keeping your CI/CD pipelines efficient and your developers focused on delivering value faster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a 100% remote company for eight years and counting now, we’ve managed to pick up employees across the world. Situated in North America, South America, all across Europe, and even as far as South Korea! (Hey, Antonia 👋)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not to be confused with our yearly onsites where the whole company gets together (previous locations including our own private island in Croatia, an eco-retreat in the mountains surrounding Barcelona, and most recently, a whole village in the South of France), the Giant Mansion focuses on our different teams getting together to focus on big rocks that they want to tackle and spend some time working face to face. We’re strong advocates of 100% remote work, but sometimes we like to hang out with each other too. So in total, twice a year, our employees get together, both in their teams and then together as the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article will show you how to automatically issue certificates using Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (IdM) and cert-manager operator for OpenShift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Securing communications is a must, not only to protect the data but to provide greater data integrity as well. Applications achieve greater communications security using cryptographic certificates, but these certificates have their own lifecycle. They need to be renewed when expired and the renewal process, when done manually, is prone to errors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This article explains the management of ACME (currently a technology preview) with IdM and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.Currently, mod_md is the only ACME client implementation completely supported and provided by Red Hat.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare announced Stream Live for open beta in 2021, and in 2022 we went GA. While we talked about the experience of using it and the value it delivers to customers, we didn’t talk about how we built it. So let’s talk about Stream Live’s design, and how it leverages the distributed nature of Cloudflare’s network, rather than centralized locations as many other live services do. Ultimately, our goals are to keep our content ingest as close to broadcasters as possible, our content delivery as close to viewers as possible, and to retain our ability to handle unexpected use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are cyberattacks that aim to overwhelm and disrupt online services, making them inaccessible to users. By leveraging a network of distributed devices, DDoS attacks flood the target system with excessive requests, consuming its bandwidth or exhausting compute resources to the point of failure. These attacks can be highly effective against unprotected sites and relatively inexpensive for attackers to launch. Despite being one of the oldest types of attacks, DDoS attacks remain a constant threat, often targeting well-known or high traffic websites, services, or critical infrastructure. Cloudflare has mitigated over 14.5 million DDoS attacks since the start of 2024 — an average of 2,200 DDoS attacks per hour. (Our DDoS Threat Report for Q3 2024 contains additional related statistics).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenAI announced support for WebRTC in their Realtime API on December 17, 2024. Combining their Realtime API with Cloudflare Calls allows you to build experiences that weren’t possible just a few days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Previously, interactions with audio and video AIs were largely &lt;em&gt;single-player&lt;/em&gt;: only one person could be interacting with the AI unless you were in the same physical room. Now, applications built using Cloudflare Calls and OpenAI’s Realtime API can now support multiple users across the globe simultaneously seeing and interacting with a voice or video AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most critical gaps in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) is that they rely on static knowledge already contained within them. Basically, they might be very good at understanding and responding to prompts, but they often fall short in providing current or highly specific information. This is where Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) comes in;  RAG addresses these critical gaps in traditional LLMs by incorporating current and new information that serves as a reliable source of truth for these models. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Within software development, security and compliance are more than simple boxes to check. Each attestation and compliance check is backed by a well-considered risk assessment that aims to avoid ever-changing vulnerabilities and attack vectors. Software development teams don’t want to worry about vulnerabilities when they are focused on building something remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we explain how Docker Hub and Docker Scout can help development teams ensure a more secure and compliant software supply chain. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hard to fathom we’re already a month into 2024! With the new year comes speculation about what’s on the horizon. Peeking around the corner at what’s next is one of my favorite pastimes. But before gazing farther ahead, it&amp;rsquo;s worth glancing back… In retrospect, 2023 was a transformative year. We connected IRL at KubeCon, VMware Explore, re:Invent and ContainerConf. Internally, initiatives like Giant Mansions and our much-loved Onsite powered human connections despite dispersed teams. As per my now-annual tradition of making predictions to navigate the year ahead, let’s check the rearview to see how accurate my 2023 forecasts proved before guessing what 2024 has in store.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Cloudflare Radar Year in Review is our fifth annual review of Internet trends and patterns observed throughout the year at both a global and country/region level across a variety of metrics. In this year’s review, we have added several new traffic, adoption, connectivity, and email security metrics, as well as the ability to do year-over-year and geographic comparisons for selected metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below, we present a summary of key findings, and then explore them in more detail in subsequent sections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 14, 2024, Cloudflare experienced an incident which impacted the majority of customers using Cloudflare Logs. During the roughly 3.5 hours that these services were impacted, about 55% of the logs we normally send to customers were not sent and were lost. We’re very sorry this happened, and we are working to ensure that a similar issue doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog post explains what happened and what we’re doing to prevent recurrences. Also, the systems involved and the particular class of failure we experienced will hopefully be of interest to engineering teams beyond those specifically using these products.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It now provides official Flatpak package and AppImage for universal Linux support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like running it in sandbox environment, then you may choose to build it from source by yourself! And, here’s how to do the job for the most recent 24.12.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to tick the checkboxes on a compliance checklist with the mindset that your system is protected and not exposed to risk. If it is this simple, why do we continue to invest billions of dollars in developing security controls and software development lifecycle (SDL) practices that help harden software and minimize risk? What is the value in configuring services, tuning firewalls, and enforcing access policies only to accept a risk rating for a vulnerability directly mapped to a base score that seemingly ignores all the work done?This contradictory model of focusing on security featur&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhancing Kubernetes API Server Efficiency with API Streaming</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/enhancing-kubernetes-api-server-efficiency-with-api-streaming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Managing Kubernetes clusters efficiently is critical, especially as their size is growing. A significant challenge with large clusters is the memory overhead caused by &lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; requests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the existing implementation, the kube-apiserver processes &lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; requests by assembling the entire response in-memory before transmitting any data to the client. But what if the response body is substantial, say hundreds of megabytes? Additionally, imagine a scenario where multiple &lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt; requests flood in simultaneously, perhaps after a brief network outage. While API Priority and Fairness has proven to reasonably protect kube-apiserver from CPU overload, its impact is visibly smaller for memory protection. This can be explained by the differing nature of resource consumption by a single API request - the CPU usage at any given time is capped by a constant, whereas memory, being uncompressible, can grow proportionally with the number of processed objects and is unbounded. This situation poses a genuine risk, potentially overwhelming and crashing any kube-apiserver within seconds due to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions. To better visualize the issue, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the below graph.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this article, we will present a means of automatically deploying an open source Cloud-Native Network Function (CNF), called Example-CNF, in order to test particular Telco-related configurations and scenarios, leveraging DPDK&amp;rsquo;s capabilities within containerized environments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Example-CNF is a workload to exercise both DPDK and SR-IOV technologies for Telco setups. The project is composed of several Kubernetes operators built with open source toolkits, such as Operator SDK, using Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) images pushed to Quay.io, deploying two main components:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the late 1990s, millions have relied on the Internet for searching, communicating, shopping, and working, though 2.6 billion people (about 31% of the global population) still lack Internet access. Over the years, use of the Internet has evolved from email and static sites to social media, streaming, e-commerce, cloud tools, and more recently AI chatbots, reflecting its constant adaptation to users&amp;rsquo; needs. This post explores how people interacted online in 2024, based on Cloudflare’s observations and a review of the year’s DNS trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Thanksgiving (November 28), Black Friday (November 29), and Cyber Monday (December 2) significantly impacted Internet traffic, similar to trends seen in 2023 and previous years. This year, Thanksgiving in the US drove a 20% drop in daily traffic compared to the previous week, with a notable 33% dip at 15:45 ET. In contrast, Black Friday and Cyber Monday drove traffic spikes. But how global is this trend, and do attacks increase during Cyber Week?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern application development has evolved dramatically. Gone are the days when a couple of developers, a few machines, and some pizza were enough to launch an app. As the industry grew, DevOps revolutionized collaboration, and Docker popularized containerization, simplifying workflows and accelerating delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, DevSecOps brought security into the mix. Fast forward to today, and the demand for software has never been greater, with more than 750 million cloud-native apps expected by 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hosted control planes (HCP) is the name of the Red Hat product for the upstream HyperShift project. It allows you to deploy the control plane of a Red Hat OpenShift cluster into an OpenShift project instead of requiring dedicated (master) nodes and attach worker nodes managed via the nodePool API to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hosted control planes architecture has several advantages when managing a fleet of clusters. It allows you to save infrastructure compute resources that would have been necessary for a standalone OpenShift topology and boosts the hosted OpenShift cluster provisioning time and day 2 automation (the provisioning time of a complete hosted cluster lasted 13 minutes in the lab used in this article, including the nodepools virtual machines (VMs) provisioning on Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elections define the course of democracies (even as there are several types of democracies), and 2024 was a landmark year, with over 60 countries — plus the European Union — holding national elections, impacting half the world’s population. As highlighted in Pew Research’s global elections report, this was a year of “political disruption,” where the Internet was a relevant stage for both democratic engagement and cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, with our presence in over 330 cities and 120 countries and interconnection with 12,500 networks, we’ve witnessed firsthand the digital impact of these elections. From monitoring Internet traffic patterns to mitigating cyberattacks, we’ve observed trends that reveal how elections increasingly play out online. As detailed in our just-published Cloudflare Impact report, we’ve also worked to protect media outlets, political campaigns, and help elections worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the dynamic landscape of cloud native technologies, a standout trend emerges: platform engineering is the new cool kid in class! In the last few months alone, it’s hard to find a CNCF event without a spotlight on platform engineering. Notably, the 2024 KubeCon EU takes it a step further, dedicating a co-located event exclusively to this rising star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why the buzz? Simply put, it’s the evolution of the DevOps mindset, now taking center stage to empower countless developer teams. At its core, platform engineering revolves around making developers’ lives significantly easier by bootstrapping development capabilities into a developer platform. Imagine a world where requesting cloud native products doesn’t lead to drowning in a sea of tickets, relying on that one infrastructure guy you know or deciphering the nuances among myriad similar-sounding AWS offerings. No, DevOps is not dead; rather, platform engineering is the formalization of the DevOps mindset, especially driven within large enterprises. Developer platforms reduce the cognitive overload of developer teams while still empowering them with self-service infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m Andrei Kvapil, but you might know me as @kvaps in communities dedicated to Kubernetes and cloud-native tools. In this article, I want to share how we implemented our own extension api-server in the open-source PaaS platform, Cozystack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes truly amazes me with its powerful extensibility features. You&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the controller concept and frameworks like kubebuilder and operator-sdk that help you implement it. In a nutshell, they allow you to extend your Kubernetes cluster by defining custom resources (CRDs) and writing additional controllers that handle your business logic for reconciling and managing these kinds of resources. This approach is well-documented, with a wealth of information available online on how to develop your own operators.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s available in Debian and Ubuntu repositories, but stuck at version 1.8.19, probably because the 2.x versions require internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the 2.x release series, then there are 3 choices: &lt;strong&gt;Flatpak&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AppImage&lt;/strong&gt;, and portable &lt;strong&gt;Linux Zip archive&lt;/strong&gt; that work in most Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Radar celebrated its fourth birthday in September 2024. As we’ve expanded Radar’s scope over the last four years, the value that it provides as a resource for the &lt;strong&gt;global&lt;/strong&gt; Internet has grown over time, and with Radar data and graphs often appearing in publications and social media around the world, we knew that we needed to make it available in languages beyond English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Localization is important because most Internet users do not speak English as a first language. According to W3Techs, English usage on the Internet has dropped 8.3 points (57.7% to 49.4%) since January 2023, whereas usage of other languages like Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch is steadily increasing. Furthermore, a CSA Research study determined that 65% of Internet users prefer content in their language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a marketer in 2024, it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone suggests a podcast. 😅 In fact, you might be working on your company&amp;rsquo;s podcast right now, or listening to one as you cruise your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, here at Giant Swarm, we&amp;rsquo;ve taken the podcast plunge ourselves. But our journey into the world of podcasting isn&amp;rsquo;t your typical marketing strategy, or at least that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re telling ourselves. It&amp;rsquo;s a story of experimentation and a genuine desire to connect in a more human way. Plus, it’s really fun to find a jingle on Fiverr each week… &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Giant Swarm is all about making your platform engineering smarter. We deliver world-class runtime capability through our Kubernetes Cluster Fleet Management, built on Cluster API, while also providing the essential tools a good platform team needs to operate their platform as smooth as cheesecake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One such essential is observability. Observability allows you to measure your system&amp;rsquo;s current state by analyzing its vitals in different forms. Storing this data over time also gives you historical insights, allowing you to compare the current state with previous ones, which makes anomaly detection and general operations of your system way easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I was introduced to image mode for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). That introduction brought me back together with some folks I’d worked with in Project Atomic, and it proved that you could orchestrate the complete build and automation of an operating system using application pipelines. Finally, sysadmins can take advantage of the same build tools developers have.Image mode for RHEL enables you to use container tools to assemble operating system artifacts. GitHub happens to have all the required tooling: source control, a built-in container registry and pipeline tools in the for&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Developers are adding a “modern background removal tool” that uses machine learning to create object masks so you can ‘cut out’ an object, person, or item in a video clip. Real-time background removal features are common in video conferencing/chat apps like Slack. They allow a user to replace their actual backdrop (like a messy kitchen) with an alternative image or, sometimes, even a video clip. And image editing tools like GIMP and Photoshop have long been […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Kdenlive 24.12 arrives stuffed like a seasonal bird with bug fixes, performance tweaks, and usability enhancements. Additionally, the editor’s developers have removed support for Qt5 so that, as of this release, it is entirely Qt6. Subtitling gets a big boost with the arrival of Advanced SubStation Alpha (ASS) subtitle support. The key benefit of these subtitles (I’ll swerve calling them ASS) is greater customisation, including things like text strokes, drop shadows, margins, and even effects like masking. A new Subtitle Manager makes editing, ordering, and […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes 1.31: Autoconfiguration For Node Cgroup Driver (beta)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, configuring the correct cgroup driver has been a pain point for users running new Kubernetes clusters. On Linux systems, there are two different cgroup drivers: &lt;code&gt;cgroupfs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt;. In the past, both the kubelet and CRI implementation (like CRI-O or containerd) needed to be configured to use the same cgroup driver, or else the kubelet would exit with an error. This was a source of headaches for many cluster admins. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes 1.31: Custom Profiling in Kubectl Debug Graduates to Beta</title>
      <link>https://ghariib.ir/posts/kubernetes-1-31-custom-profiling-in-kubectl-debug-graduates-to-beta/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/kubernetes-1-31-custom-profiling-in-kubectl-debug-graduates-to-beta/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ways of troubleshooting the pods and nodes in the cluster. However, &lt;code&gt;kubectl debug&lt;/code&gt; is one of the easiest, highly used and most prominent ones. It provides a set of static profiles and each profile serves for a different kind of role. For instance, from the network administrator&amp;rsquo;s point of view, debugging the node should be as easy as this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$ kubectl debug node/mynode -it --image&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;busybox --profile&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;netadmin&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, static profiles also bring about inherent rigidity, which has some implications for some pods contrary to their ease of use. Because there are various kinds of pods (or nodes) that all have their specific necessities, and unfortunately, some can&amp;rsquo;t be debugged by only using the static profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post describes &lt;em&gt;Pod failure policy&lt;/em&gt;, which graduates to stable in Kubernetes 1.31, and how to use it in your Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-pod-failure-policy&#34;&gt;About Pod failure policy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you run workloads on Kubernetes, Pods might fail for a variety of reasons. Ideally, workloads like Jobs should be able to ignore transient, retriable failures and continue running to completion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To allow for these transient failures, Kubernetes Jobs include the &lt;code&gt;backoffLimit&lt;/code&gt; field, which lets you specify a number of Pod failures that you&amp;rsquo;re willing to tolerate during Job execution. However, if you set a large value for the &lt;code&gt;backoffLimit&lt;/code&gt; field and rely solely on this field, you might notice unnecessary increases in operating costs as Pods restart excessively until the backoffLimit is met.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes 1.31, by default kubectl now uses the WebSocket protocol instead of SPDY for streaming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post describes what these changes mean for you and why these streaming APIs matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;streaming-apis-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;Streaming APIs in Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes, specific endpoints that are exposed as an HTTP or RESTful interface are upgraded to streaming connections, which require a streaming protocol. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, a streaming protocol provides a persistent connection that&amp;rsquo;s bi-directional, low-latency, and lets you interact in real-time. Streaming protocols support reading and writing data between your client and the server, in both directions, over the same connection. This type of connection is useful, for example, when you create a shell in a running container from your local workstation and run commands in the container.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Volume group snapshots were introduced as an Alpha feature with the Kubernetes 1.27 release. The recent release of Kubernetes v1.32 moved that support to &lt;strong&gt;beta&lt;/strong&gt;. The support for volume group snapshots relies on a set of extension APIs for group snapshots. These APIs allow users to take crash consistent snapshots for a set of volumes. Behind the scenes, Kubernetes uses a label selector to group multiple PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting. A key aim is to allow you restore that set of snapshots to new volumes and recover your workload based on a crash consistent recovery point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Kubernetes v1.31 release, &lt;code&gt;kubeadm&lt;/code&gt; is adopting a new (v1beta4) version of its configuration file format. Configuration in the previous v1beta3 format is now formally deprecated, which means it&amp;rsquo;s supported but you should migrate to v1beta4 and stop using the deprecated format. Support for v1beta3 configuration will be removed after a minimum of 3 Kubernetes minor releases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through key changes; I&amp;rsquo;ll explain about the kubeadm v1beta4 configuration format, and how to migrate from v1beta3 to v1beta4.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes v1.31, we are excited to introduce a significant enhancement to CPU management capabilities: the &lt;code&gt;distribute-cpus-across-cores&lt;/code&gt; option for the CPUManager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha and hidden by default, marking a strategic shift aimed at optimizing CPU utilization and improving system performance across multi-core processors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-feature&#34;&gt;Understanding the feature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; CPUManager tends to allocate CPUs as compactly as possible, typically packing them onto the fewest number of physical cores. However, allocation strategy matters, CPUs on the same physical host still share some resources of the physical core, such as the cache and execution units, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes v1.32, after years of community discussion, we are excited to introduce a &lt;code&gt;strict-cpu-reservation&lt;/code&gt; option for the CPU Manager static policy. This feature is currently in alpha, with the associated policy hidden by default. You can only use the policy if you explicitly enable the alpha behavior in your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-feature&#34;&gt;Understanding the feature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The CPU Manager static policy is used to reduce latency or improve performance. The &lt;code&gt;reservedSystemCPUs&lt;/code&gt; defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons and kubernetes system daemons. This option is designed for Telco/NFV type use cases where uncontrolled interrupts/timers may impact the workload performance. you can use this option to define the explicit cpuset for the system/kubernetes daemons as well as the interrupts/timers, so the rest CPUs on the system can be used exclusively for workloads, with less impact from uncontrolled interrupts/timers. More details of this parameter can be found on the Explicitly Reserved CPU List page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With Kubernetes 1.32, the memory manager has officially graduated to General Availability (GA), marking a significant milestone in the journey toward efficient and predictable memory allocation for containerized applications. Since Kubernetes v1.22, where it graduated to beta, the memory manager has proved itself reliable, stable and a good complementary feature for the CPU Manager.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of kubelet&amp;rsquo;s workload admission process, the memory manager provides topology hints to optimize memory allocation and alignment. This enables users to allocate exclusive memory for Pods in the Guaranteed QoS class. More details about the process can be found in the memory manager goes to beta blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes scheduler is the core component that selects the nodes on which new Pods run. The scheduler processes these new Pods &lt;strong&gt;one by one&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, the larger your clusters, the more important the throughput of the scheduler becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Kubernetes SIG Scheduling has improved the throughput of the scheduler in multiple enhancements. This blog post describes a major improvement to the scheduler in Kubernetes v1.32: a scheduling context element named &lt;em&gt;QueueingHint&lt;/em&gt;. This page provides background knowledge of the scheduler and explains how QueueingHint improves scheduling throughput.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canonical is continuously hiring new talent. Being a remote- first company, Canonical’s new joiners receive a unique onboarding experience. In their first weeks, they are introduced to the different departments and the various tools they use to work asynchronously across the globe. New hires develop a good understanding of the open-source technologies that the company deploys and supports such as Openstack, Kubernetes, Kubeflow and OpenSearch – in addition of course to Ubuntu, the world’s most famous OS, which they install on their laptops. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re embarking on an expedition through the archives of Giant Swarm’s blog.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re dusting off our virtual time machines and donning our trusty Sherlock hats (aka looking at old links 😀) to decode the mysteries hidden within our old blog posts. But hold on, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a mere nostalgia trip; we&amp;rsquo;re on a quest to uncover nuggets of wisdom and bring back some forgotten treasures. In a world that hurtles forward at lightning speed, it&amp;rsquo;s all too easy to forget the paths we&amp;rsquo;ve walked. As we wander down memory lane, we&amp;rsquo;ll catch glimpses of our growth and witness the winds of change that have shaped our journey. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cloud and DevOps promised to make our infrastructure faster, cheaper and easier. However, in many organizations, this promise, unfortunately, fell short. Engineering teams find themselves trapped in a cycle of duplicating infrastructure, agonizing over the tools and components for each &amp;lsquo;unique&amp;rsquo; use case, grappling with security concerns, and ultimately navigating the complex realm of operations. In some cases, disillusioned organizations are even retracting workloads from the cloud – a scenario exemplified by the well-known case of 37Signals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to its latest financial report, Mozilla’s revenue in 2023 hit &lt;del&gt;$653 million (US), up from &lt;del&gt;$593 million in 2022. The cause of the increase? Not any flashy new products, services, or deals – just ol’ fashioned interest and dividends (&lt;/del&gt;$47 million) and returns on its investments (&lt;/del&gt;$24 million). In fact, Mozilla’s income from search engine deals actually fell by ~$15 million in 2023. Revenue from ads, sponsored links, and its own product subscriptions (like Pocket) also dipped by ~$9 […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever built a piece of IKEA furniture, or put together a LEGO set, by following the instructions closely and only at the end realized at some point you didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; follow them correctly? The final result might be close to what was intended, but there&amp;rsquo;s a nagging thought that maybe, just maybe, it&amp;rsquo;s not as rock steady or functional as it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Internet protocol specifications are instructions designed for engineers to build things. Protocol designers take great care to ensure the documents they produce are clear. The standardization process gathers consensus and review from experts in the field, to further ensure document quality. Any reasonably skilled engineer should be able to take a specification and produce a performant, reliable, and secure implementation. The Internet is central to everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives, and we depend on these implementations. Any deviations from the specification can put us at risk. For example, mishandling of malformed requests can allow attacks such as request smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

OpenShot—more accurately, ChatGPT or similar—says “OpenShot 3.3 is here to transform your editing experience! This release is as powerful as it is beautiful […] Take your video editing to the next level with OpenShot 3.3. Download it now and see the difference”. The headline change in OpenShot 3.3 is the use of a new default theme called Cosmic Dust. This apparently offers a “modern editing experience”. The new theme looks nice, it I’m not sure it […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/our-top-ai-articles-of-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we close out the year, we&amp;rsquo;re rounding up the articles that resonated the most with our readers on Linux, Kubernetes and OpenShift, Ansible automation, programming languages and runtimes, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love it or hate it, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to gain momentum across industries in 2024. This enthusiasm was reflected on the blog this year, with a focus on building technical skills for learning and working with AI.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year brought many enhancements to the Red Hat OpenShift AI platform for building AI-enabled applications as well as other new AI solutions. At Red Hat Summit, we announced Podman AI Lab, an extension for Podman Desktop that lets you build, test, and run generative AI-powered applications within containers on a local environment. And in September, there was the general availability release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) AI, a foundation model platform that makes it easy for users with little to no data science expertise to experiment with large language models. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be almost January yet. As the new year approaches, it&amp;rsquo;s time to reflect on the top learning paths Red Hat Developer published this year, along with highlighting key paths that were too new to make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter what kind of developer you are, it can be difficult enough to keep up with the technologies you already work with. Learning new areas, tools, and products can be daunting on top of managing heavy workloads, so structured self-service developer learning has come to the forefront as an important option for skilling up and learning new things. That explains the strong success of our beginner content, as you will see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/recipe-for-efficient-development-simplify-collaboration-and-security-with-docker/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Collaboration and security are essential for delivering high-quality applications in modern software development, especially in cloud-native environments. Developers navigate intricate workflows, connect diverse systems, and safeguard applications against emerging threats — all while maintaining velocity and efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of development as preparing a multi-course meal in a high-pressure, professional kitchen, where precision, timing, and communication are critical. Each developer is a chef working on different parts of the dish, passing ingredients (code) along the way. When one part of the system encounters delays, it can ripple across the process, impacting the final result. Similarly, poor collaboration or security gaps can derail a project, causing delays and inefficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/resilient-internet-connectivity-in-europe-mitigates-impact-from-multiple-cable-cuts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When cable cuts occur, whether submarine or terrestrial, they often result in observable disruptions to Internet connectivity, knocking a network, city, or country offline. This is especially true when there is insufficient resilience or alternative paths — that is, when a cable is effectively a single point of failure. Associated observations of traffic loss resulting from these disruptions are frequently covered by Cloudflare Radar in social media and blog posts. However, two recent cable cuts that occurred in the Baltic Sea resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries, as we discuss below, in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/rightsizing-your-platform-team-escape-the-growth-trap-giant-swarm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post explores why even well-intentioned platform engineering initiatives tend to result in teams becoming larger than expected over time. It examines the drivers behind this growth trap and provides strategies for rightsizing based on organizational needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As more companies recognize the strategic importance of platform engineering, many are jumping in with the allure of starting small — the classic &amp;ldquo;two-pizza team&amp;rdquo; mindset. However, all too often these initiatives fall into the &amp;ldquo;platform trap&amp;rdquo; — where teams continuously grow way beyond initial projections. At Giant Swarm, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen this play out time and again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since containers became hot, there are fewer scenarios where IT professionals have to deal with virtual machines (VMs) in their day jobs, but from time to time you need something that’s hard or impossible to replicate inside a container and virtualization tools remain a crucial part of a developer’s toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early container tools created huge security concerns: any user would be an effective root user, and those tools made it easy to run arbitrary code and circumvent protections provided by mechanisms such as SELinux and Linux kernel capabilities. Later container tools, such as Podman, emphasized rootless modes of operation to prevent such security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As the feature request descripted:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;it&lt;/code&gt; is implemented as a special case of &lt;code&gt;getlocal&lt;/code&gt; insn, not a method. &lt;code&gt;it&lt;/code&gt; without an argument is considered &lt;code&gt;_1&lt;/code&gt; or a normal local variable if defined. &lt;code&gt;it&lt;/code&gt; is considered a method call only when it has any positional/keyword/block arguments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This approach is by design to avoid duplication since the dock is always visible (by default) so those app shortcuts are always in reach – each app shortcut only shows once. Not everyone likes this behaviour, especially if Ubuntu Dock auto-hide is enabled. Naturally, there are 3rd-party GNOME Shell extensions one can install to make sure all apps show in the main applications grid irrespective of whether they’re pinned to Ubuntu Dock (or […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sometimes I cache: implementing lock-free probabilistic caching</title>

      <guid>https://ghariib.ir/posts/sometimes-i-cache-implementing-lock-free-probabilistic-caching/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTP caching is conceptually simple: if the response to a request is in the cache, serve it, and if not, pull it from your origin, put it in the cache, and return it. When the response is old, you repeat the process. If you are worried about too many requests going to your origin at once, you protect it with a cache lock: a small program, possibly distinct from your cache, that indicates if a request is already going to your origin. This is called cache revalidation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that many shops are increasingly using e-paper displays. They’re impressive: high contrast, no backlight, and no visible cables. Unlike most electronics, these displays are seamlessly integrated and feel very natural. This got me wondering: is it possible to use such a display for a pet project? I want to experiment with this technology myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Be8SEo0lqoZ0t10tPbtcT/ffa6f9263df05392d7c4408e9c98bc28/Screenshot_2024-12-23_at_15.26.23.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(source)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My main goal in this project is to understand the hardware and its capabilities. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using an e-paper display to show the current weather, but at its core, I’m simply feeding data from a website to the display. While it sounds straightforward, it actually requires three layers of software to pull off. Still, it’s a fun challenge and a great opportunity to work with both embedded hardware and Cloudflare Workers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anthropic recently unveiled the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a new standard for connecting AI assistants and models to reliable data and tools. However, packaging and distributing MCP servers is very challenging due to complex environment setups across multiple architectures and operating systems. Docker is the perfect solution for this — it allows developers to encapsulate their development environment into containers, ensuring consistency across all team members’ machines and deployments consistent and predictable. In this blog post, we provide a few examples of using Docker to containerize Model Context Protocol (MCP) to simplify building AI applications. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phishing remains one of the most dangerous and persistent cyber threats for individuals and organizations. Modern attacks use a growing arsenal of deceptive techniques that bypass traditional secure email gateways (SEGs) and email authentication measures, targeting organizations, employees, and vendors. From business email compromise (BEC) to QR phishing and account takeovers, these threats are designed to exploit weaknesses across multiple communication channels, including email, Slack, Teams, SMS, and cloud drives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Time Zone Database Package (&lt;code&gt;tzdata&lt;/code&gt;) provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with the time zone information needed for all applications or runtimes in the operating system to print local time correctly. The GNU C Library (glibc) uses the &lt;code&gt;tzdata&lt;/code&gt; package, so APIs like &lt;code&gt;strftime()&lt;/code&gt; work correctly, while applications such as &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/date&lt;/code&gt; use this information to print the local date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tzdata&lt;/code&gt; package contains the data files describing current and historic transitions for various time zones worldwide. This data represents changes required by local governments, time zone boundary changes, UTC offsets, and daylight saving time (DST).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Stream launched AI-powered automated captions to transcribe English in on-demand videos in March 2024. Customers&amp;rsquo; immediate next questions were about other languages — both &lt;em&gt;transcribing&lt;/em&gt; audio from other languages, and &lt;em&gt;translating&lt;/em&gt; captions to make subtitles for other languages. As the Stream Product Manager, I&amp;rsquo;ve thought a lot about how we might tackle these, but I wondered…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I just translated a generated&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;VTT&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(caption file)? Can we do that?&lt;/strong&gt; I hoped to use Workers AI to conduct a quick experiment to learn more about the problem space, challenges we may find, and what platform capabilities we can leverage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, software virtualization has allowed retailers to deliver improved store-based applications without the need to add hardware capacity. Customer-facing applications such as stock control and customer loyalty programs, and colleague-facing applications such as replenishment and staff rotas are critical to store success. As the number and complexity of store applications increases, retailers will frequently use hardware and software virtualization techniques to support the increased demands for capacity while avoiding the cost of supplying additional hardware.

We get 2 new releases of Ubuntu each year, one in April and one in October. Plus, new point releases of the latest long-term support release rolling up bug fixes, app updates, and back-porting newer Linux kernels and GPU drivers. So 2025 should be another golden year for Ubuntu, those of us using it, and the Linux and open-source community as a whole. Changes to Ubuntu in 2024 span a wide […]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This technique enhances generative AI models by utilizing external knowledge sources such as documents and extensive databases. RAG addresses a gap in traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). While traditional models rely on static knowledge already contained within them, RAG incorporates current information that serves as a reliable source of truth for LLMs. Although LLMs can rapidly understand and respond to prompts, without RAG, they often fall short in providing current or more specific information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, computers are more sophisticated, interconnected and complex than ever. This means they’re more capable than ever – but it also comes with a downside: that their attack surface is larger than ever, leading to an elevated risk of cyber incidents. Therefore, your approach to managing vulnerabilities needs to be holistic and prepare for all the ways in which vulnerabilities could cause damage to users, systems or your organization’s operations and reputation. In short, you need a vulnerability management plan. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“You don’t want to think about security — until you have to.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s what I’d tell you if I were being honest about the state of development at most organizations I have spoken to. Every business out there is chasing one thing: speed. Move faster. Innovate faster. Ship faster. To them, speed is survival. There’s something these companies are not seeing — a shadow. An unseen risk hiding behind every shortcut, every unchecked tool, and every corner cut in the name of “progress.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
